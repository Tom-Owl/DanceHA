1,"I was going on a trip to Japan, and so was anxious to get the 2 lb. Eee-pc rather than lugging around my 7 lb Lenovo.  For the most part the eee-pc worked fine.  It boots quickly, has a good user interface (except the file manager takes some getting used to), connects to the Internet (wire or wireless like a charm). However, I don't like Mozilla as a browser because it doesn't provide some of the services when used with Microsoft exchange server mail I tried and failed to find and install an alternative browser like Netscape.  Also, I needed a SFTP program, and failed to find one I could install. I guess I just don't get along well with Linux when it goes beyond pre-installed software.

The software included with the Eee-PC is worth the price of the machine itself -- The word processor opens and writes almost every format, the Presenter Program is compatible with PowerPoint, although has a limited number of designs (2).  However, when I hooked the machine to an LCD projector we could get the screen to switch resolutions to give a full projection (may have been my lack of understanding, but we had to switch the presentation to a full-size laptop).  I wanted to install the Open Office Database, but could figure out how to do that.

All the USB peripherals I used with the Eee-PC worked fine, including an HP all-in-one printer, external USB hard disk, and USB mouse.  The weakest part of the machine and the reason I returned it, was the keyboard and the mouse buttons on the touch pad.  The USB mouse solved the mouse button problem, but the keyboard was annoying, often missing letters or adding in double letters (bounce).  I could have used a USB keyboard but that defeats the purpose of buying a 2 lb machine. So, I understand there is a slightly larger format machine coming out in the summer -- maybe that will do the trick if they can keep the weight down and install a Windows XP operating system, I'd buy it.","[

This output reflects a consensus drawn from the three LLM agents' analyses. The sentiments described across the aspects highlight significant dissatisfaction with the functionality, purchase experience, recommendation, and perception of price and quality related to the product. These conclusions align with the strongest overlap among the agents' assessments."

The CASE is cheap and the matte finish is poorly done.
The Screen protector didn't come with an apparatus to remove air-bubbles so had to use a CC.
the silicone keyboard cover doesn't sit well; as in flushed it overlaps on the right and all the keys on the left portion is slightly off; thereby causing the overlap on the right. SOOO it really pretty much is worthless if it doesn't block dust n liquid as described.

The part that holds the ipad is a little akward at first, but I've gotten use to it and really like it. I also like that I can fold the ipad over the keyboard to use as a tablet and not worry about touching the keys. Great product.","```json

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**
- **Aspect Term:** ""case"" and ""cover"" were consistently identified, with some variations observed concerning ""size"" and ""versatility"" in Agent 2.
- **Aspect Category:** Predominantly categorized as ""out of scope"" for ""case"" and ""cover,"" despite Agent 2 suggesting ""laptop design_features.""
- **Opinion Term:** All agents consistently highlighted strong positive sentiment through opinions like ""Absolutely perfect!!!!!!!"" and ""works like a charm.""
- **Sentiment Polarity & Intensity:** Uniform strong positive sentiment for most aspects, affirming high product satisfaction.
- **Integration Approach:** Integrated overlapping and agreeing outputs, primarily leaning on ""out of scope"" due to the non-explicit relevance to predefined laptop-related categories. Judged by consensus and prominence in repeated similar aspect terms and sentiment.

24,"UPDATE: After having this for just a few months we've had serious issues with quality. My daughter's broke within a month, but it was the dongle piece that fits in the computer that broke and she does carry it to classes, so it might have been knocked around. Then after only a few months (and too late for return), mine has stopped scrolling properly. I love the comfort and fit, and the price was very good, but not if you need to buy 2x/yr. I'm up in the air about what to replace it with - should I give it one more try?
----
I don't normally fall in love with new tech gadgets instantly, and I thought it might take a couple weeks to get used to a completely different mouse design. It felt comfortable and natural straight away. The pointer accuracy is there, the ergonomic design fits my medium sized hand comfortably, and the surface texture of the mouse just feels nice. Most importantly, it definitely relieves my discomfort. I'm left wondering why all mouses aren't made with the vertical design? Terrific value. I got one for my college kiddo and she loves it, too. I should have gotten this sooner.","```json

26,"Okay, so when I bought these, I didn't have high expectations.  I am rating three star mostly because the top speed I can get out of these is 200Mbps.  That is about 24MBps.

First of all, they claim to have 1000Mbps up and 1000Mbps down.  I tried various configurations and couldn't get them to get that speed.  Going through two breaks made the performance degrade down to 100Mbps.  Going through only one breaker gave me 200Mbps.  The only thing that I could think of on how someone could get 1000Mbps is if they were on the same breaker but this is unrealistic in most home solutions.

I did noticed after i plugged it into a switch and tried two different computers transferring a large file, the performance on one of them degraded in speed to almost 1MB/s which wasn't thrilling.  Still testing all of the capabilities.

If you purchase this, just don't have high expectations unless you will be on the same breaker.

Overall I am thrilled with the speed, but I might be purchasing a wireless access point later this year and routing that closer to where my dead spot is in the house.","```json

**Conclusion:**

- **Aspect Term Identification:** The aspect term ""product"" was consistently identified by all agents in the highly negative sentiment expressions about the overall quality and satisfaction with the purchase. Similarly, ""performance"" was identified concerning functionality issues.

- **Aspect Category:** The term ""product"" was placed under ""out_of_scope general"" because it refers to the item as a whole without specifying any predefined laptop categories. For ""performance,"" agents 1 and 3 agreed on ""laptop operation_performance,"" which encapsulates the operational issues like lagging and inconsistency.

- **Opinion Term Extraction and Sentiment Polarity:** Specific opinion terms such as ""HATE"", ""most frustrating"", ""terrible"", and ""hate it!!!"" express strong negative sentiments toward the ""product."" For ""performance,"" terms like ""lags"" and ""only works sometimes"" reflect issues with its operation, all consistently recognized as negative.

- **Sentiment Intensity Score:** The consensus among agents for the intensity of the sentiment toward ""product"" was an extreme negative, assigning it a score of -5. For ""performance"", the agreed score is -2, indicating moderate to strong dissatisfaction.

This synthesis integrates the consistent elements from each agent's analysis, resolving minor discrepancies to provide a unified assessment."

]
```

### Final Consolidated Conclusion:

1. **Aspect Term Identification:**
    - The aspect terms identified across the agents were ""replacement unit"" and ""camera"".

2. **Aspect Category Assignment:**
    - For the ""replacement unit,"" there was alignment between Agent 1 and Agent 3 as ""operation performance"" being out-of-scope or hardware related. However, due to lack of direct feedback, this term is best categorized as ""out_of_scope operation_performance"".
    - For the ""camera,"" all agents agreed on the category: ""multimedia_devices operation_performance"".

3. **Opinion Term Extraction:**
    - The consolidated opinions for the ""camera"" included ""acting strange,"" ""flash on and off rapidly,"" and ""work correctly"" after considering frequency and relevance of terms across agents.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:**
    - ""replacement unit"" received a neutral sentiment with an intensity score of 0, unanimously agreed upon by agents with consensus leaning towards out-of-scope.
    - For ""camera,"" although individual intensity scores varied, the final decision assigns it a negative polarity with a consensus intensity score of -3 given the consistent negative description of issues. 

In conclusion, the primary sentiment analysis points to problems with the camera's operation, while the reader's anticipation for the replacement unit remains neutral in scope."

    }
]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **First Output:** All three agents identified the expression ""Great product!!!"" as related to the laptop. The majority placed it under a positive sentiment with intense scores, and the most consistent category chosen was ""laptop general"". Thus, we keep the same opinion term as Agent 1 for its completeness and positive polarity with a strong score of 5.

2. **Second Output:** There was some discrepancy between agents regarding the ""I can use my laptop without having to keep it on charge 24/7."" sentence. Agent 2 highlighted a positive sentiment focusing on laptop use without constant charging, assigning it a sentiment intensity score of 2 under the ""laptop operation_performance"" category. Combining insights, it's rational to classify this as reflecting positive sentiment towards ""battery operation_performance"", capturing the idea of battery endurance/performance positively described by the ability to use the laptop without constant charging."

33,"The processor isn't the latest, fastest one out there, but unless your are doing movies and photography for your occupation you may be able to get everything you need to do ... done on this Macbook Pro for a third or quarter of the price of a new one. Soooo glad I bought this 17 inch (the HD screen on this is stunningly beautiful) and the processor is fast enough for most programs. As an educator, this will do everything I need it to do with MS Office, iLife including iPhoto and iMovie, and a few productivity apps. I'm not running Final Cut Pro but even this Core 2 Duo still flies through the things I use it for. I'm not a gamer either so why pay thousands for a 1000 HP motor if a 357 Chevy will get you there in style? This is one of the Apple bargains right now in my opinion. I'm in love with this loaded-with-power and beauty laptop! I also have an iMac desktop so the combination of the two makes a great duo that does everything I need very impressively! Highly recommended, even in 2014!","```json

Few things to know about it though: 1. As a chrome book it's main program is google so you need to have gmail in order to set a passlock, the main programs aren't Microsoft word, excel, and PowerPoint (which is what I was used to) instead it has google made programs such as google docs. After using it for many apon many essays for school I realized that google docs is very smart. You can access any of the documents on any computer when you sign into your gmail account which is a blessing when you need to print your essay and forgot your flash drive & computer.

35,"Upgrading/downgrading (depends how you look at it) from Sony NEX 5N due to the lack of good/reasonably priced lens is getting frustrating. I want a camera that is smaller than DSLR, takes excellent photos, good prime lens selection and can take good video (i'm fine with 720 30p). The E-M5 seemed to fit the bill.

Overall, it takes the best m4/3 photos in low light that I've seen (I've used GF1, GX1, E-P3). But comparing kit lens to kit lens i like the jpeg output from the Sony better.

So why 3 Stars?
- Camera is really small but hefty. Both of these characteristics are good, but it makes it really hard to hold since there is barely any grip.
- On/off switch placement is awkward
- On/Off switch feel extremely flimsy like a piece of plastic that will eventually break off after extensive use.
- Humming sound upon power up. Sounds like my laptop when the fan is running.
- Video has strobe effect (background appears to be flashing) when zooming in or out.
- A lot of focus hunting when taking video using kit lens.
- Long and complex menu...I thought the Sony menu was bad, this is even more complex.
- Mushy and small buttons. Prefer hard plastic buttons instead.
- Flip screen, to get it 90 degrees facing up is a 2 step process. Sony is one.
- OLED has greenish/blue tint when viewed at a slight angle.
- Price....for $1.3K I can not overlook the issues mentioned above, maybe I'm expecting too much. If it was $400 cheaper then this is a 5 star camera and I can overlook those UX issues.
- planning to wait for the G5 or GH3 instead.","```json

**Final Conclusions:**
1. **Aspect Term**: `battery` for the first group and `portability` for the second group.
2. **Aspect Category**: `battery operation_performance` for battery issues, and `laptop portability` for the portability concern.
3. **Opinion Term**: For the battery, **""same problem""** and **""does not charge!!!""** reflect the user's negative experience. For portability, the terms **""suppose to be portable""** and **""no battery""** highlight the issue with portability due to battery failure.
4. **Sentiment Polarity**: Both aspects have a **negative** sentiment.
5. **Sentiment Intensity Score**: 
   - For the battery operation_performance, the sentiment intensity score is **-5** (strong negative) based on the unanimous agreement on the problem's severity from the input.
   - For laptop portability, the sentiment intensity score is **-3** (strong negative), reflecting consistent dissatisfaction due to the impact on portability."
39,I wish I could love this keyboard. It has goood construction and design. The backlight works great and the keys feel good and the trackpad does the job well enough. Mouse button placeement is awkward but that is about it. However holding the ctrl button on the keyboard sends a shutdown commands to a windows 7 machine. This means you will inadvertantly shutdown your computer when you do not mean to if you should be trying to use a shortcut command or miss the shift button.,"```json

### Explanation:
1. **Group 1 (Laptop):**
   - **Aspect Term:** ""laptop""
   - **Aspect Category:** Although there was a suggestion of ""laptop price"" in some agents, the consensus weighted more towards the general admiration of the laptop, so the category was finalized as ""laptop general.""
   - **Opinion Term:** ""terrific!!!!"", ""phenominal!!!!""
   - **Sentiment Polarity:** The sentiment is unanimously ""positive"" across agents.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** The strong appreciation expressed justifies a maximum intensity score of 5.

2. **Group 2 (Microsoft Office):**
   - **Aspect Term:** ""Microsoft Office""
   - **Aspect Category:** ""software price"" was the consistent category noted by the agents.
   - **Opinion Term:** ""expensive"", ""FREE!""
   - **Sentiment Polarity:** Although Agent 3 rated it negatively due to ""expensive,"" the overwhelming context of relief and value from ""FREE!"" dominates. Therefore, the final sentiment is ""positive"".
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** A moderate positive score of 2 captures the overall feeling towards the free offering, balancing the minor negative concerning ""expensive."""
41,"... I read the reviews submitted before my own, I thought that I'd be makin a good decision to purchase these headphones over the scores of others I considered. First thing I noticed when I got these headphones was; THEY ARE HUGE!!! I have big ears and my entire ear ended up sitting INSIDE the headphones  ear-cup, as opposed to having the outer rim press against my ears, having the inner ear cup aligned with my inner ear. Next thing I realized was, the headphones felt flimsy, and weak, and had exposed screws above the ear-cup, I thought I could overlook these factors if they actually SOUNDED GOOD, so I hooked them up to my computer. The sound was low and distant - the bass was virtually non-existent, the treble was thin, and I swear those volume controls on each side did nothing less than annoyed me. I thought it may have been my computer, so I tried it with a couple other portable devices, it sounded the same. I tried my $13 computer headphone/microphone set with my devices, and they sounded ALOT better! In conclusion, buy these headphones if you like walking around with bass-less, thin sounding headphones that look like grapefruit halves on either side of your head!!","```json

42,"What is has:

7.0"" 16M-color LCD capacitive touchscreen of 1024x600 pixel resolution; 170 ppi
Android OS v4.2.2 with TouchWiz
1.2 GHz dual-core Cortex-A9 CPU, GC1000 GPU, 1GB of RAM, Marvell PXA986 chipset
2 MP autofocus rear facing camera with face detection
VGA video recording at 24fps
8 GB internal storage, microSD slot max. 32GB
3G version with voice communication and SMS available - NOT included in this model
Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n support
GPS with A-GPS connectivity; GLONASS support
Stereo Bluetooth v4.0
microUSB port for charging, USB charging cable, wall adapter
Accelerometer sensor
Standard 3.5 mm audio jack
Document editor and file manager comes preinstalled
3600 mAh battery

Main disadvantages:

No USB OTG support - No HDMI port
Low screen resolution-1024x600
Feeble chipset-only 1GB RAM
Only one speaker and placed at the back
No front-facing camera

If you're looking for a compact and inexpensive tablet - one you wouldn't worry about getting lost or damaged - this is as good a choice as any. This tablet is a stripped down version of the Galaxy Tab 3.  Want to use SKYPE?  Sorry, no front facing camera.  Want to attach a USB stick, mouse or keyboard?  Sorry, no USB OTG support.  The tablet is extremely basic, primarily for tasks like reading and sending email, reading a book or magazine, watching Netflix or streaming music. The tablet works ok for what it is and I get about 6-9 hours out of the battery before recharge depending upon how I am using it.
The tablet will work well as a travel tablet, or one for the kids to use.  Just don't expect too much of it.

Competition:

The ASUS MeMo Pad HD7 costs the same as the Samsung tablet but has better screen resolution, faster quad-core processor, front camera, higher-res rear camera and is lighter.
The Lenovo IdeaTab A3000 matches the Lite in all aspects: display size and resolution, Android version, battery but adds a front camera, better rear camera, USB OTG and a more powerful processor at the expense of a little extra thickness and weight.

Again, not a bad tablet for the price, but there are other tablets available with better specs for the same money.  If this tablet were priced between $100 and $120, it would be a good deal.  At $150+, it's just too expensive for what you get.","```json

44,"VERY nice screen protectors at a VERY good price, but EXTREMELY difficult to put on without LOTS of bubbles! I had to keep lifting it up, like 14 times, and gently pushing the bubbles as I was lowering the protector before letting it lay flat, because once it's laid flat, you can't push/work the bubbles off to the edges like you can with most other ones. I got them for my granddaughter and she had asked me do it for her, because I am really good at it, have done them MANY times over the years and I have INCREDIBLE patience (and I like a PERFECT screen!). But I cannot see her being able to do these by herself, so I bought her some glass protectors, as they are MUCH easier to put on.
I am giving it 4 stars, though, because once I got it on, completely bubble-free, it looks and feels really nice!

### Explanation:
1. **Keys (Aspect Term: ""keys"")**
   - The consensus among all agents is that the aspect term ""keys"" is associated with negativity due to its usability issue.
   - The opinions such as ""Just TOO SMALL"", ""too small"", and ""toooooo long"" consistently denote a strong negative sentiment towards usability, and a score of -4 is appropriate based on the consistent strong negativity in all agents’ outputs.

2. **Charge (Aspect Term: ""charge"")**
   - All agents agree that the ""charge"" refers to ""battery operation_performance"" and is described positively.
   - There's a slight variance in the intensity score, with some agents citing 3 and one agent using 4. Using the consensus, a score of 4 is designated due to the emphasis on a strong positive aspect (""great!"") in terms of operational performance."

56,"Just got this today - seems very well built. It's a perfect fit for my HP M7 laptop in the main middle compartment. The rear compartment is supposed to be for folders with a divider in it but I use it to carry a small compact camera and a pair of headphones with room to spare. The front pocket is a bit small with a velcro closure flap and side zippers so it can open wide. Not a big fan of the velcro ""RRRIP"" sound, perhaps another zipper or clasp closer would have been nice - I can fit in a wireless trackball and the charger and cord and a Belkin surge protector plus a bunch of other small stuff. Might be a concern and I will have to keep an eye on it are the plastic D rings that the shoulder strap attaches to. They are sewn into the sides of the bag and held by a bit of strapping material that only appears to be stitched at that one point - the strapping material does not extend around the bottom of the bag as my older laptop bag had- which seemed a secure reinforced method of supporting the weight of a 17"" laptop. The shoulder strap itself seems pretty sturdy and is attached to the D rings by carabiner-like connectors, also plastic that allow free rotation making it easy to untwist the shoulder strap if it ever does get twisted. Overall, it is nice and light, made of a textured fabric like material. I'll have to see how it holds up to daily use.
Update: the first day I used it, it felt good, nice and light. At end of day, with laptop all snug inside, I picked it up by the shoulder strap and slung it over my shoulder and started walking out to my car. After a few steps, the rear carabiner let go of its D ring and the bag dropped to the ground! I managed to grab the strap as it was falling and only the corner of the bag hit the concrete. Laptop is ok but I had to find out why that carabiner/hook let go. After fiddling with it for a few minutes, it is possible for this hook/carabiner to get positioned when the strap is hanging slack down and when the bag is lifted up by the strap, the springy metal part gets wedged against the d ring, and when weight is put on it, it releases and slips out of the d ring. I'll take a photo of how this can happen and add it here. Anyway, to keep this from happening again, I zip-tied the carabiner so the spring release can't open. But it was a scary moment when it released suddenly and may laptop was falling!","```json

65,"Nice motherboard with handy overclocking software. Only gripe is the cheap IO shield. A piece of it got lodged into a USB port and I didn't notice until I was waaay done building, so I had to cut it out. Half the fault goes to it being my first build, though. The XMP switch is handy as tinkering with OC settings took the RAM out of XMP mode occasionally.

Not a big issue, but I'm not a huge fan of the goofy little plastic caddy to make installing the CPU easy. I tried it for the heck of it, but needing to press the CPU into the caddy requires touching the bottom of it in some way, which you wouldn't need to do otherwise. It also adds some volume to the installation obviously, and the latch really creaked as I locked the processor in. Installed fine, but not a fun sound to hear! Just watch a youtube vid on installing CPU's and ditch the caddy.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1 - Receiver:** 
   - All three agents agreed on the neutral sentiment with no specific opinion terms related to the receiver purchase or usage from Amazon, keeping the aspect term as ""receiver"" under ""out_of_scope general"".

2. **Group 2 - Marantz Receiver:**
   - A consensus emerges around the ""marantz"" aspect, highlighting the positive sentiment associated with its performance compared to Yamaha. Although Agent 3 did not break down ""marantz"" as a distinct aspect, Agents 1 and 2 did, and recognizing the clear contrast made between products, categorizing as ""out_of_scope operation_performance"" fits better for this comparison sentiment.

3. **Group 3 - Sound Quality:**
   - All agents concur on the ""sound quality"" with positive sentiment. With agreement on sentiment terms, it aligns best with ""multimedia_devices quality"", noting the specific mention of sound attributes."

84,"I bought my ClamCase almost a year and a half. I was so excited to get my sturdy, multi-function ClamCase, and paid $149 plus shipping.

It is not a solid case, it cracked on two corners, it no longer looks whites but rather a beige or grey color, and the rubber corners have come off. I used it at home, watch Netflix, read, or research stuff. So I have never dropped it or had it fall onto the ground.  It cracked just from sometimes the Ipad snapping off the case.

I have rarely taken outside, and feel like I have taken good care of it.  And I have also rarely charged the keyboard. I have just gotten used to the Ipad keyboard. But now that I wanted to use the ClamCase keyboard, it will not charge.

I emailed ClamCase but to this day I have not heard from anyone.

So for $149 I feel like I just but a cover for my Ipad.  I wouldn't recommend it.  I should have spend less on an Ipad cover.  Lesson learned.

Don't buy it!!!","```json

**Rationale:**

1. **Processor & Internet Browser:**
   - All three agents agree on the categorization and sentiment towards the processor and internet browser. The intensity score and category are synchronized across agents, depicting a strong negative sentiment due to perceived poor operation performance.

2. **Apps:**
   - Both Agents 1 and 2 categorize the issues with apps as ""software operation_performance"" with a sentiment intensity score of -3, which is indicative of some operational issues, aligning with the functional disruptions mentioned.

3. **Keyboard Function:**
   - There is agreement on the keyboard function's poor operational performance with both ""keyboard function"" and ""keyboard"" confirming the negative sentiment intensity of -3. This shows consensus on its poor usability.

4. **Video Chat Applications:**
   - Consistent strong negative sentiment is expressed by Agents 2 and 3, with Agent 1 less intense. Based on the overlap, a score of -4 is assigned to capture the severity of the functional limitations.

5. **Tablet:**
   - Negative sentiment about the tablet's value is clearly emphasized. All agree on categorizing this under ""laptop quality"", with varying intensity scores from -3 to -4. Since Agent 3 sees it more negatively, and with strong points raised, -4 is chosen.

6. **Price:**
   - Regarding price perception, sentiment ranges from -2 to -3. Given the sarcasm implied in the final sentence about value, a moderate negative sentiment intensity score of -2 aligns well with the general consensus across agents.

This final consolidated result considers cumulative assessments from agents to provide a rigorous and balanced ABSA result."

**Rationale:**

1. **Charger Aspect Term:** All agents identified the charger as a significant aspect tied to both the ""perfect replacement!!"" and the positive sentiment expressed with ""sooo happy"". Both opinions are captured, and given Agent 1 and 3's consensus on the ""power_supply general"" category, this is selected. Sentiment intensity is high at +5 due to the strongly positive terms used.

2. **Replacement Aspect Term:** While Agent 2 isolated ""replacement"" under ""out_of_scope general"", the term overlaps with the sentiment for the charger. Hence, it was rationalized together with the charger aspect.

3. **Laptop Aspect Term:** This was identified through mixed sentiment about being ""quite old"" and generating ""worry"", as mentioned by Agents 2 and 3. The ""laptop general"" category was consistent across agents. The net effect of both negative (""quite old"", ""worried"") and positive (""sooo happy"") opinions results in a mixed sentiment overall. Sentiment intensity is considered low positive given the resolve (""sooo happy"" about not buying a new laptop)."

### Explanation:

- **Aspect 1:** The opinions on the ""look of the unit"" differ slightly, with LLM Agents noting both positive and negative opinions. The overall sentiment is negative due to the stronger negative expression.
  
- **Aspect 2:** A consensus among the agents on the negative sentiment regarding the need for replacement. The sentiment intensity ranges between -3 and -4, so a compromise at -3 is taken.
  
- **Aspect 3:** All agents agree on the negative impact of the sd card function, though they vary on sentiment intensity. Based on the majority and the specific mention of malfunction across agents, an intensity score of -4 is selected.

- **Aspect 4:** There is agreement on the positivity of the Bluetooth feature, reinforcing correctness in aspect-category pairing and opinion term use.

- **Aspect 5:** Consistent positive sentiment on replacement decision, though categorized as out-of-scope given its context in the input text."

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1**: All agents identified a sentiment related to price, but there's a discrepancy in sentiment polarity. Two agents perceive it as negative, focusing on relative pricing to other options, not commenting favorably about this specific laptop. Therefore, settled on negative polarity, intensity -2.

2. **Group 2**: Consensus on negative sentiment concerning keyboard usability and opinions such as ""ridiculous!!!"" and ""getting used to."" Sentiment intensity varies slightly, but majority aligns toward -3 intensity.

3. **Group 3**: Consensus on negative sentiment related to mouse usability. Intensity scores averaged to a consensus score of -3.

4. **Group 4**: All agents agreed on aspect (windows) and sentiment (negative) regarding operation performance. Thus, intensity average supports -2 score.

5. **Group 5**: Agreement on negative sentiment regarding general opinion about laptop quality and usability, with mention of ""cannot possibly make it any worse!!!"" Providing a final intensity score of -4 based on consistent agreement."

107,"Okay so...so far I absolutely love it. I see people complain about not being able to do much but the web store actually has a lot....i can fully do my homework and upload documents perfectly fine. Another thing that people complained about was only being able to print on the cloud but i have a desk printer that is not wireless and i have to plug in the USB and since my printer is a HP printer there is an app on the web store called hp print and it print everything easily just like a normal PC printer just plug it in and choose the destination. Nothing has really changed from switching over from a PC to a Chromebook other than how fast Chromebook is compared to a PC,,,,It just works for me...I do recommend doing your research to see which one is the best for you. I went in circles trying to choose between the new Toshiba or an Acer but overall i think that the HP was the perfect fit for me. I have had no restrictions so far.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

114,"I like this laptop, really i do, i just have some minor complaints due Microsoft Crappy Vista and the bloatware that Acer includes in this model, but the machine overall is good and well for less than us$ 500. A lot of hard drive ( i suppose they're offering so much of it because all of the programs that comes with it), a lot of memory etc.

Well this is a good laptop, would be better if:

a) The Operating system was other that Windows Vista ( that's a crap of an OS) Vista has failed i don't know HOW many times since i bought this laptop.
b) If this model didn't bring a ton of bloatware, and when i say a ton i MEAN IT!, a lot of games and crappy programs that you won't EVER use in your life.
c) This SHOULD come with the installing cds but NOOOO Acer had the good idea to leave that to you ( I've tried to make my backup twice and burning the second cd the operation failed) --> that's worrisome.
d) I don't like the surface of the laptop, it gets a lot of fingerprints.
e) The heat can get a little uncomfortable if you have it by say ummm 2 hours on your lap.","```json

### Consolidation Process

1. **Aspect Term:**
   - ""product"" from Agent 1 and 3, not considered out of scope by Agent 2.
   - ""photos"" and ""video"" were consistent across all agents, under either ""multimedia_devices quality"" or ""operation_performance"".
   - ""operating system"" and ""touch screen"" were consistent across all agents.
   - ""price"" was consistent as an aspect term across all agents, with sentiment being neutral.

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - For ""photos"" and ""video,"" I chose ""multimedia_devices quality,"" which both Agent 1 and Agent 3 agreed upon given the context.
   - For ""operating system,"" chosen was ""os operation_performance,"" which was consistent across all agents.
   - For ""touch screen,"" ""display quality"" was selected as per the consensus of Agents 1 and 3.
   - ""product"" was consolidated under ""laptop general"" considering the overall negative sentiment about the product.

3. **Sentiment Intensity Score:**
   - Scores for ""photos"" and ""video"" were set at -5 following Agents 1 and 3's more consistent strong negative sentiment.
   - For ""operating system,"" -4 was chosen to align with Agent 3's assertion of strong negativity.
   - For ""touch screen,"" a strong intensity of -5 was selected due to the concurring strong negative sentiment from Agents 1 and 3.
   - For ""price,"" the neutral sentiment intensity of 0 was selected in keeping with the consensus of all agents' analysis.

The consolidated conclusion draws upon the majority views of the LLMs, aligning wherever possible with the repetitions and agreements across the analyses."

**Explanation:**
1. **Aspect Term & Sentiment for 'product':** 
   - All agents identified 'product' with variations of 'excellent' as a positive sentiment. The consensus categorical assignment aligns more closely with ""laptop general"" due to its focus being about the overall nature.
2. **Aspect Term & Sentiment for 'i7 processor laptop':** 
   - The combination ""Best"" and ""hot too much"" accounts for a mixed sentiment as per the majority interpretation; this is reinforced by LLM agent 2's mixed designation and intensity score of 0. Thus, the category chosen here is ""cpu operation_performance,"" reflecting the heat issue related to usage."

123,"Here  is my problem and the service tech told me that this computer should not have external HDDs attached when booting.  This is an utterly stupid answer

I have a problem with booting my computer if I have more than four external drives on my 7 port hub.  If it has completed booting with four drives on the hub, and I add additional drives to the hub, the computer can handle the additional load just fine.  Just during the boot phase the computer hangs with a blank, black screen, no DELL logo appears.  If I remove all drives except four, turn the computer off by pressing and holding the on/off button for five seconds and then turning it back on, it boots just fine.  I down loaded and tried to flash the eprom with  Inspiron_3647_3847_A04 version off of your support site and when I tried to install it, the reply was that I already had the latest version.

So much for DELL Tech Support experts??????

**Explanation**:

- For the first aspect, both Agents 1 and 3 identified ""performance"" as the aspect term and categorized it under ""laptop operation_performance,"" which is more precise than Agent 2's ""speed"" and ""hardware operation_performance."" This has been consolidated and given a strong negative sentiment intensity score of -5, reflecting the unanimous agreement on the negative sentiment across the agents.

- The second aspect regarding the ""wish i could give it 0 stars!"" was identified by Agent 2 as ""rating"" in the ""laptop quality"" category with a strong negative sentiment intensity score of -5. This is consistent with the general expression of profound dissatisfaction.

- The third aspect for usability is recognized separately by Agent 2 and corresponds to the expressed frustration in using the device, categorized under ""laptop usability,"" with a strong negative intensity score of -4. 

In conclusion, the final output integrates the best analyses of the three agents, giving a comprehensive view of the aspects and sentiment expressed in the text."
136,"Started really working out about 4 months ago, and realized just how much I sweat. Never really liked the cheap white earbuds that came with my ipod to begin with, but once I started working out I noticed they don't like sweat, cutting out, falling out, being uncomfortable, etc. So I thought I'd give these a try. Well worth the money. They sound great, way better then those tin can sounding, little, hard white things. They hold up to my sweaty workout routines, they fit nice, and come with different sized plastic dealies for different sized earholes (yea I said earhole). Not to mention they sound waaaaaaay better than what I'm used to. All in all, unless your an audiofile freak who needs perfect concert sound. These little babies are pretty sweet.","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

**Rationale:**

- In the first entry for ""purchase,"" the majority of agents agreed on a positive sentiment related to price, with strong phrases like ""best"" and ""worth every penny!!!!"" The category ""laptop price"" is most appropriate as it aligns with the product mentioned.
  
- For the second entry related to ""keyboard,"" multiple agents highlighted the positive sentiment through terms like ""love"" and ""fantastic."" The consensus category ""keyboard design_features"" captures both the specific design feature and qualitative sentiment expressed towards the keyboard being ""real.""

- The aspect concerning ""onscreen keyboards"" is consistently negatively perceived by all agents, primarily focusing on usability issues demonstrated by terms like ""never liked"" and ""way too many incorrect keys."" ""Keyboard usability"" is the best-fitting category based on the agents' assessments."

**Consolidated Conclusion:**

1. **Aspect Term:** ""laptop"" is consistently identified across all agency outputs from the main context.
   
2. **Aspect Category:** The category is best determined as ""laptop quality"" given the consistency between Agent 2 and Agent 3, with Agent 1's broader category grouped into an advanced quality determinant.

3. **Opinion Term:** Both ""terrible"" and ""Do not buy!!!!"" are essential sentiments noted by Agents 1 and 3. Even though Agent 2 separated these sentiments, the observed collective reasoning dictates keeping both phrases.

4. **Sentiment Polarity:** Clearly negative, as aligned across all agents.

5. **Sentiment Intensity Score:** A score of -5 reflects a strong negative sentiment where Agents 1 and 3 farthing noted intense dissatisfaction, solicitation not to purchase, supporting the score chosen."

158,"This seems to be a reasonable ball head for the price if you stick to very lightweight cameras -- even more lightweight ones than the product specs suggest.

Using the Giotto's 3/8 inch socket by taking out the 1/4 inch bushing, mounting this diminutive head on my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Manfrotto-055XPROB-Pro-Tripod-Legs-Black/dp/B000UMX7FI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Manfrotto 055XPROB Pro Tripod Legs (Black)</a>&nbsp;gives me just barely under 2 turns of threading, which is solid enough for most point-n-shoots on this, admittedly, overkill tripod for such a purpose.

I have no idea how long the threads will last, but all of these connections are well within the sturdy range.

My only negative observation is that the advertised load capacity for this ball head is overly optimistic: this is fine for point-n-shoots, but when I have grabbed this in a pinch for my Nikon D60 with a lightweight lens, the mount is anything but steady, even on the Manfrotto, even though the total weight of the camera, lens (a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nikon-50mm-f-1-8D-AF-Nikkor-Lens-for-Nikon-Digital-SLR-Cameras/dp/B00005LEN4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nikon 50mm f/1.8D AF Nikkor Lens for Nikon Digital SLR Cameras</a>, battery, card, and camera strap weigh in at ONLY 2lbs, 1oz -- less than HALF of the Giotto's advertised ""load capacity"" of 4.4lbs. It holds together, but just barely, and it's a bit wobbly. I know this product is not designed for a DSLR, but shouldn't any product perform steadily at _under half_ of its advertised load capacity?

Just in the odd case that someone would consider getting this mount for the Manfrotto tripod mentioned above, I'd recommend against it -- the thumbscrew on the ball head is so close to the wide base of the ball-head mounting surface on the Manfrotto and is so short, that it's quite difficult to tighten.  I haven't noticed that problem mounting the Giotto to quick-releases on cheaper tripods, though.

My complaint is that the effective weight rating for this product appears to be under half of what it advertises.","[

It converts instantly between tablet and laptop mode too, which I love.

Great computer at a real good price. I searched for months before finally picking this computer and I am really happy with my choice!!!  :)

164,"I thought I'd edit this review now that I've had my drive for a while longer. The original review is below the line and still applies for while the drive is functional. The problem is this: These drives aren't actually particularly robust. What looks like a USB flash drive is actually a very small microSD card reader and a microSD card, encased completely in a plastic shell. The card reader part is the part that stops working (and when it does it basically just gives you a ""you don't have permission to access this drive"" error when you try to copy to it), so I was able to break the outer plastic case and remove the microSD card, which helped offset the loss of the drive a little. This seems to be a common problem with these drives, so be careful if you buy one.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
When I was looking for a usb drive I was trying to find the smallest one that had a decent amount of storage and was sufficiently durable. This excluded most of the the drives with moving parts (sliding or swiveling covers) and left this drive and two others on Amazon as possibilities. I'm very happy I ended up choosing this drive. It's pretty much as small as a usb drive can get (just the actual usb interface and about 1/4 inch beyond that) which is great for my purposes. I have it attached to my keyring and I didn't even notice any additional bulk when I attached it with the included little keyring leash. I've noticed some people have a little difficulty getting it out of their computer when I'm letting them borrow it but I haven't had any difficulties, so it's probably just an issue of having a tiny bit of practice. Overall I've had zero problems and highly recommend it.","```json

166,"I was able to pair the keyboard just fine, but the touch pad was nearly non-responsive (it didn't seem to matter how close I was to the device being controlled).  Often I would move my finger across the pad and the cursor wouldn't move, other times the cursor would just move seemingly randomly. The keyboard worked better, but some of the keys suffered from bounce, when you press a key once, the letter would appear multiple times. My application requires the touch pad to work properly so I had to return it as it just didn't work. Maybe I got a lemon, but other people have experienced the same issues so I'll look else where.

The form factor seems decent and I think I would have been reasonably satisfied if it has actually worked. I would prefer it just uses a couple of AAA's that are replaceable, the unit has a built in rechargeable battery which will certainly fail within 2-3 years, .","```json

Pros : Great when it is working
Cons : Keyboard died for no apparent reason!!!!

Update: Great customer service from the manufacturer. I was a very happy on how they handled my warranty service request. They will be sending a replacement. They really stand behind their product. I am upping this rating to a full 5 stars since I really liked the keyboard and with a great warranty service experience, I highly recommend this product and manufacturer!!!","```json

It works really well for what I use it for, Internet browsing, downloads, homework, and playing the sims 2. the buttons next to the power screen make it easy to bring up music right away, the wireless works really well and the battery power is somewhat reasonable (it still lasts about 2 hours on a full charge). in march i had to have the dc jack repaired, which took about 2 weeks, but it was under warranty so at least i didn't have to pay for it. it has a nice hard drive and i have plenty of space to store all my class assisgnments, photos, and videos. the webcam is a little gritty but it still works really well. one thing i don't really like is the speakers. they work well, but they are designed to basically collect dirt, and there is no real way to clean them. the keyboard is glossy and i love it, but it tends to collect a lot of lint.

181,"I gave this product a 4/5 stars for overall performance, but I give it a 5/5 for the job I ask it to do: which is take notes in college classes.

It doesn't have a place to store my stylus (I knew that going in, but it'd be nice to have). It also doesn't have a battery gauge, so I can't tell where my battery life is. I haven't had any problems with it dying and previous review have it lasting a long while, but I do wish I could monitor the battery life. The bluetooth turns off if you haven't used it in a few minutes - which while I'm sure that's great for battery life, it's frustrating to feverishly take notes after a period of no activity because the bluetooth has turned off. The keys are also a little small, but I don't have much trouble typing quickly; it may be frustrating for writing papers or anything important.

Even with allllllll those negatives, they're really very minor in the grand scheme of things. I love the bluetooth so I can move the tablet or keyboard around independently of each other and the case is really nice and secure. Definitely a great investment for use in note taking/minor computer tasks, but probably wouldn't recommend for long term, intense use.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. For the ""Packaging"" aspect, I consolidated the data from across the agents. Agents 2 and 3 identified ""packaging"" related to quality categories and sentiments, and Agent 3 specified ""shipping quality,"" which aligns most reasonably when considering the context of packaging. Therefore, the category ""shipping quality"" was selected.

2. Concerning the ""Quality of product"" aspect, all agents agreed on its sentiment expression and category, which is ""laptop quality,"" reinforcing consistency in this category assignment.

3. For the ""Protective cover,"" all agents uniformly identified ""laptop design_features"" and reflect a strong consensus in terms of sentiment polarity and intensity. As no contradictions occurred here, this aspect remains unchanged.

This final output integrates and reconciles agent responses to establish a unified interpretation of aspects and sentiments in the text."
189,"Good little computer but you've got to put some effort in.... you get what you pay for.

You need the extra ram which isn't as simple as some reviews make it seem. ( it comes with 1Gb of ram and windows 7 takes almost that entire Gb to run basic functions sooo if you want to do anything else -like use firefox -  you need the extra Gbs.)

And

You need office suite to do office things (which isn't easy to install without an external CD drive)

SOOOO - if you don't mind putting in the extra effort (and you have access to an IT department at school which will help you input the ram AND will sell office for like $15) then it is totally worth it.  Now that our's is all dolled-up - we love it.","Final ABS Analysis:

197,"Nice keyboard, But missing lot of necessary features:

THe GOOD: PBT keycaps goodness( most keyboar come equipped with ABS),but these for 50 dollars have PBT caps...this is something that other popular manufacturer like Corsair, and RAZER need to do with all their keyboard..especially when they chagin hundred of dollars for their. With that said these caps kind of have thoes old  2014-2015 version razer keyboard weird rubber feel on the keycaps though, So it might be a fingerprint magnet overtime. RGB LED, look pretty nice with these caps, maybe it's just me. Run bluetooth 4.0..so wire is not really necessary. FEEL pretty premium for 50 dollars. plus Brown Switches...not as annoying as Blue, but are better than red IMO,[Not as smooth, but prefer tactile bumps, because it make my finger happy to type on them. ALSO, this keyboard is gonna be easy to clean.

THE BAD: No dedicated function media Keys, NO Battery Indicator Light, AND DOES NOT INCLUDE A BLUETOOTH ADAPTER WITH PURCHASE, and the 20 hours battery life? not sure on this.. have not fully test the hours.

Yeah it's a good buy, but it still missing lot of feature listed above...So, I think if you want another better one Try the ANNE PRO, it is around 70-80.dollars They do not have the dedicated media keys or arrow keys, but have the option on their mobile app to implement onto the keyboard...Which is what this keyboard really need, an mobil app. Still, I like this keyboard...I can't say the reason, maybe because the switches and the keycaps..Not sure.. Keeping it for typing, and possibly gaming purposes as well.

(Update) Nuuuuuuuuuu.... after a few weeks of constant use, the charging port became very wobbly, and now it won't even charged/work correctly when it's plugged in. media keys can be macro on mouse it was nice while it lasted.. the exterior is nicely build, but i guess it's the internal that need works. ALSO, the pbt keycaps will be fingerprint  magnets  after sometime,  and those print icon on  the front side of the keycaps will eventually decay, think it had already started on my. still is nice budget rgb bluetooth keyboard though for the price..but wait until it drop down to $50, not around 60.  ALso seem like they took off the brown switch version of this on amazon...eh that's unfortunate.","```json

**Consolidated Solution:**

The final ABSA result integrates the findings of all three LLM agents. The categorical analysis is based on the consensus and relevance of each aspect term discussed:

1. For ""unit,"" the most agreed upon category is ""laptop quality"" with a clear positive sentiment showing strong construction, reflected by the consistent high intensity score given by the agents.

2. For ""computers""/""'puter's,"" the agents agreed on a negative sentiment due to the user's experience of them not lasting long. Categorically, ""laptop general"" best fits since it refers broadly to laptops.

3. For ""large HD screen,"" the agents unanimously recognized the display as a design feature with a strong positive sentiment, supported by an intensity score of 5. Here, the category ""display design_features"" is most frequently addressed for this aspect, aligning with the expressed supportive sentiment. 

This approach ensures comprehensive integration of agent insights while addressing any discrepancies responsively, maintaining a rigorous ABSA output."

**Rationale:**

- **Group 1 (Computer):** All three agents agree on the aspect term ""computer"", opinion term ""absolutely love"", positive sentiment polarity, and intensity score of 5. Thus, “laptop general” is the appropriate category, as all agree on sentiment and sentiment strength.

- **Group 2 (Operating System):** Agents provided different terms for the aspect. The consensus across agents favors focusing on ""Windows Vista"" as it created a negative impression due to ""back to the dark ages."" The category “os general” is chosen as it directly pertains to the operating system, capturing the main sentiment issue expressed.

- **Group 3 (Batteries):** All agents identify the aspect term “batteries” and agree on a negative sentiment polarity and a score of -2, reflecting dissatisfaction with performance. “Battery operation_performance” is the aligned category for this sentiment across agents.

- **Group 4 (Seller):** All agents assign the sentiment as negative towards the seller, influenced by strong disappointment expressed in the terms. The intensity score decided as -4 harmonizes with how significantly the sentiment was expressed in terms of disappointment, affecting the “company general” category most directly."

This consolidated output is a combination of insights from all three agents, ensuring to align on key aspects like the term ""unit"", which is consistently related to the laptop's quality and performance across agents. The variation in categories has been rationalized to fit under the most representative categories such as ""laptop quality"" and ""laptop operation_performance"". The sentiment intensity scores have been averaged where necessary, adhering to group consensuses. The aspect terms have been standardized (e.g., ""Unit"" versus ""unit"") for clarity and consistency."

220,"I bought this laptop a year ago from Circuit City as a present for my husband.

In less than a year it had a hard drive and a cd/dvd drive replaced, and the batttery pack, ram, and the OS and programs, removed, and installed over and over again.

New year's eve was spent talking to technical service people from India, and Seattle, on the first day of the new year more of the same with India and finally with some Spanish speaking people.

Last time I heard from a supervisor of the supervisor that I needed to fax the receipt for the purchase of the laptop in order to bring it to another supervisor to determine what to do. I still have not heard from them.

The laptop is an useless paperweight, sad reminder of money, time, and confidence in HP lost.

Bottom line, buy MAC.","```json

**Explanation:**
1. **""Case"" aspect**: 
   - Agents 1 and 3 identified ""case"" with positive sentiments. Agent 2 referred to the aspect as ""quality"", but considering the common ground across the agents, ""case"" is the most fitting aspect term.
   - The opinion terms ""Really cute"" and ""good quality"" consistently express positivity across agents, supporting a positive polarity with a sentiment intensity score leaning towards agents 1 and 2's stronger intensity scores.

2. **""Fit"" aspect**:
   - There is consensus on the issue of fitting with negative sentiment due to the size misfit. Despite Agent 3 referring to ""laptop size"", the underlying sentiment and expression align with concerns regarding fitting.
   - The negative sentiment is strongly agreed across agents with similar negative expressions, leading to a strong negative intensity score as outlined by agents 1, 2, and 3.
   - Based on the categories provided by agents 2 and 3, the issue relates best to design features of the laptop size, under ""laptop design_features""."

**Explanation:**

- **Group 1:** Majority consensus pointed towards the device having a general negative aspect rather than being tied specifically to price in a consistent manner. This aligns with the widespread mention of ""horrible"" in relation to ""device"" by all agents, confirming the 'laptop general' category based on overall sentiment about the device.

- **Group 2:** For the ""battery"" aspect, it was consistently categorized under 'battery operation_performance,' with negative sentiment reflecting its inability to hold a charge and difficulty syncing. The highest intensity was used due to the strong negative sentiment highlighted by difficult syncing functions.

- **Group 3:** The ""clarity"" aspect was unanimously agreed to have issues in the ""display"" context, categorized under 'display quality' with consistent negative sentiment captured by all agents.

- **Group 4:** The ""products"" aspect was primarily linked to company pricing issues, shared by all agents, indicating a focus on this as a company-wide problem. Negative, strong sentiments were consistently captured by all agents.

- **Group 5:** Focus on pricing was consistent across responses for sentiment related to the device price, where hesitation and disapproval were strongly indicated. Adjusted the sentiment intensity to moderate considering varied agent scoring (-5 and -2) averaging to a more balanced -3."
223,I bought my wife this model less than a year ago and I had to get me one.  Performs well and you can't beat the price.  Large screen and light weight.

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**

- All three agents agreed on the primary aspect term ""computer"" and categorized it under ""laptop general.""
- The opinion terms primarily highlight positive sentiment with ""great"" and ""Love it!!!"" being common across the agents, justifying a positive sentiment polarity.
- An intensity score of 5 is assigned for the positive sentiment, aligning with the strong positive vibes indicated by ""Love it!!!.""
- A neutral sentiment is also identified by Agent 2 with the opinion ""more than I will ever need,"" validated by the factual nature of the statement without emotional connotation, further supporting a neutral sentiment polarity with a score of 0.
- The group structure is revised to consolidate the sentiment information, acknowledging the separate expressions of sentiment within different contexts provided."

236,"Design flaws:
i) The trackpad makes a weird noise when you click. (Mac book doesn't)
ii) There is no option to make right click a primary click. This defies the whole purpose of having a clickable trackpad. (Mac book doesn't have this problem)
iii) I type a lot. My previous SONY VAIO was so nice to type on. It's difficult to type in this thing. (Mac book is so easy to type on)
iv) The fan vent is in a place which could be easily blocked if you prefer working on bed. (Mac book pro's vent is located in a place where it is impossible for someone to block it.)
v) No HDMI port. (Mac book does)
vi) The display could be better. (Mac book has such a crisp display)
vi) If your finger is wet, then it is hard to use the trackpad. (You can use macbook's trackpad even with a sweaty or wet hands)
vii) The lid doesn't have a good latch. It easily closes if your laptop is tilted. (Macbook pro's lid has a very good latch).

Things that I like:
i) Thin (Thinner than macbook pro)
ii) SSD
iii) Good speakers
iv) Cheaper than macbook pro but macbook pro delivers a well designed and a fine product with the price.  $1600 price tag on series 9 doesn't deliver the deserved and expected quality/design.

(I love macbook pro but I am not a fan of their ""closed"" OS and their price). So I had to chose a windows based laptop. Chrome book is small and their OS is kind of weird. Microsoft OS is old (Old is gold) and many programs are developed for windows machine. I chose series 9 with high expectation but was a little disappointed. Based on the experience, may I please recommend buying either Dell Inspiron 15z or Lenovo X1 Carbon or Asus 15 inch Zenbook prime.","```json

239,"Ok. I skimped and got the non-pro version. Fine. So many reviews out there saying that yu'll see so little difference between SSD models in real life, the *real* gain is over HDDs. This is what I observe...
[NOTE System is HP Pavilion DV6, i5 2410M processor (dual core with Turbo Boost tech), SandyBridge (i.e. SATA 3 compatible) with 8GB DDR3 PC3-10700 (2x4 GB) and now with this SSD 250 GB and Hitachi HDD 750 GB. Running Win 7 Home Proffesional 64]
1) Real easy to install, especially with the Magician Software provided by Samsung. Likewise you can firmware upgrade without having to wipe your system. Nice.
2) I also bought a USB 3.0 memory stick to go with the USB 3 ports that I have and transferring (large) files around is blisteringly quick now - like 150 MB/s quick (Lexar JumpDrive - awesome).
3) Benchmarking. The drive does what it says on the box. 500 MB/s read this and 250 MB/s write (large files). IOPS whatever it claims. All benchmarking tests seemed to show no lies in the product blurb.
4) REAL LIFE. I have done my background research, although I'm no computer expert. In Magician there is a secion to ""Optimize your system for SSD usage"" - disable ""superfetch"", disable ""indexing"", disable ""defragmenter""... says AHCI should be enabled but that doesn't appear in my bios. All done. TRIM is enabled and free space is 50% to date of the drive. Junk files are cleaned regularly. And so I get to my point...
Solidworks, Photoshop CS3, IE9, Picasa 3.9, Left for Dead 2 (representative selection of what I have on my SSD) etc etc etc. None open blazingly quickly. A slight gain over a HDD, but then I did just reinstall Windows, that usually happens to me. Yes computer startup is quick now, maybe twice as quick, but again, a new Windows install is always quicker for me. Shut down still takes an age (WHY MICROSOFT WHY!?!!!!) Have I REALLY gained here? I'm just not sure I have, PERFORMANCE wise (file transfer-wise, yes).

Anyone got any tips for me? I am clearly seeing some SSD benefits, but am sorely missing others. Why isn't my CS3 opening SO SO fast like so many test sites claim? Why is shut down still a pain? How come I see such great benchmarks and file transfers and start up even when the aforementioned advntages are missing?

Any help would be greatfully received!!!

Summary. Inconclusive. Works, yes. Gains, yes. All the benefits that are ""claimed"" by SSD preachers... Yet to see. 3* or me...","```json

249,"First, I'm not much of a TV guy, so I can't really rate the picture quality. To me it looks great, but I don't have much to compare it to.

I am however, an engineer who does embedded software development for a living. And that means that I recognize a firmware bug when I see one. And I've seen three after only about two weeks of usage. And that's with the latest available firmware as of 02/2010, version 1.08

We use this TV for two purposes:

1.) To connect our family computer to it (via HDMI) and enjoy the nice 1920x1080 resolution
2.) To watch some HDTV content which we receive via an outdoor antenna - using the built-in ATSC tuner.

Here are the problems so far:

1.) Whenever we switch to the PC (via HDMI) we can still hear sound from the TV channel. It's very faint, but it's audible - especially since we sit directly in front of the TV when using the PC. This is reproducable - not just a one-time event.

2.) Once, when watching ATSC TV, reception was poor and the TV went into a ""loop"" always repeating the last 3-5 seconds of video and sound - similar to an old vinyl record that skips... This stopped only when we changed the channel and then went back to the original channel. So far this only happened once, but it looks like the internal error handling for ATSC TV is not foolproof.

3.) When switching from HDMI (PC mode) to TV, we had no sound. Volume was turned on, but we heard nothing. Eventually we increased the volume to what would have been quite loud, and finally the sound came back - suddenly and loudly. We were than able to decrease the sound back to the regular range without it disappearing.

None of these are real serious problems, but they leave the impression that the firmware is still a bit immature...

I would have still rated it 4 stars, had it not been for Philips customer support who so far has sent me nothing but meaningless pre-canned replies when I alerted them to these problems....

At the end of the day though - we don't regret the purchase.","```json

However, I bought this thing to use with my Raspberry Pi via bluetooth.  The Pi connects and pairs to the keyboard, but I cannot get it to register any input.  Its annoying.  More annoying than this, is that I would love to reset the board so that it forgets all the paired devices and starts fresh. I have not found a way to do this... and re-pairing is an exercise in absolute futility.  I cannot for the life of me re-pair the device, despite following the instructions, which simply state that you hold FN+Q or W or E for 5 seconds.  First pairing seems to work, but after that, good luck.  The online manual states that you can hold 4 keys to reset the board but, this doesn't work.  If the bluetooth connectivity could be improved.... 5 stars, especially at this price.","```json

Explanation:
1. **Keys Aspect Term**: For the first group, there was a consensus on the aspect term and the negative sentiment expressed. The category was determined as ""keyboard operation_performance"" based on the majority and the context of how ""keys are sticking"" impacts performance.
   
2. **Keyboard Aspect Term**: The sentiment related to the suggestion to find another keyboard was consistently negative across agents. The category ""keyboard quality"" was selected, aligning with two agents and the essence of the complaint about poor quality.

3. **Money Aspect Term**: There was alignment on the aspect term and sentiment intensity for the statement ""This is a waste of money!!!!"" The category ""company price"" was selected for the final result, taking into account the broader interpretation that such a statement reflects dissatisfaction with the financial aspect associated with the product."

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Group ID 1 - Keyboard Issues:**
   - All agents identified ""keyboard"" as the primary aspect term, with the consistent sentiment being negative.
   - The sentiment intensity reflects the strong negative feedback (-5) due to repetitive issues described (letters sticking, repeated characters).
   - The category **""keyboard operation_performance""** is appropriate, considering the issues with typing performance noted by multiple agents.

2. **Group ID 2 - Returning the Product:**
   - The consensus among agents is the aspect of returning, with the opinion being ""piece of junk"" used negatively.
   - The category was varied among agents (out_of_scope, laptop miscellaneous, shipping), but I chose **""laptop miscellaneous""** as it fits the context of returning due to dissatisfaction.
   - The sentiment intensity is notably strong (-5), uniformly described as negative by all agents.

3. **Group ID 3 - Device Connectivity Issues:**
   - Agents identified issues with restarting and reconnecting, with consistent negative sentiment.
   - ""The same thhhhhhhhhhing"" issue on other devices influenced the negative sentiment.
   - The category is best described as **""hardware operation_performance""** due to connectivity issues affecting performance, with the sentiment intensity marked at -3, indicating a persistent but less intense problem than typing issues."

**Conclusion Integration:**

Based on the analyses from the three LLM agents:

1. **Pwr+ ac adapter** is consistently identified across agents as a key aspect with strong positive sentiment. Two agents categorized it under ""power_supply quality"" with an intensity score of 4, focusing on the satisfaction and recommendations provided in the text. This was the predominant opinion derived from the responses.

2. **adapter** in terms of operational performance (""work just fine"") was highlighted by one agent with a slight positive sentiment, categorizing it as ""power_supply operation_performance"" with an intensity score of 2. This allows for a nuanced look into different aspects addressed in the text.

The final output reconciles these findings to present a comprehensive view of the aspects and their associated sentiments."
263,"Previously owned several notebooks from Sony to Dell & Fujitsu which the last was the best by far in almost each category. My new U305-S7477 is replacing a year old Dell laptop and I happened to enjoy almost everything about this model. The screen is bright and crisp,a powerful figuration, and nice looking and operating notebook. I definitely find it as an efficient business tool as a road warrior. A long battery life 7800 mAH lithium-ion battery and not 5200 mAH as mentioned on Amazon's specs (which probably applies to other figurations), and relatively light, and overall pleasant to use. The only downside which isn't as bad as some reviews indicated is the keyboard flex issue, yet with nice texture and comfortable size. Amazon's amazing extremely fast shipment and follow-up system made it a perfect experience. Almost as the Fujitsu I had mentioned earlier but for the half of the price. Strongly recommended!!!","```json

**Explanation:**
- Group 1 reconciled different categorizations of ""item"" as relating to its description being accurate, resulting in a neutral sentiment, agreeing with the ""out_of_scope general"" category from Agent 1.
- Group 2 agreed with the product being ""very easy"" to use, combining Agent 1 and 2’s aspects of out_of_scope while maintaining usability.
- Group 3 maintained the strong positive sentiment relating to recommendation from Agent 2, aligning with Agent 3’s strong intensity score but kept the clearer categorical divide of “recommendation”."

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category for ""size"":** The consensus from agents suggests the aspect term ""size"" with equal weight given to either ""laptop design_features"" or ""laptop portability."" Considering the multiple agreements and common interpretation, ""laptop design_features"" was selected to match the aspect's description of ""just right size.""

2. **Aspect Term and Category for ""keys"":** All agents agree on the aspect term ""keys"" and category ""keyboard usability"" with minor variation in opinion term precision. The union of their analyses results in the aspect ""easy to use"" being the most fitting consensus.

3. **Aspect Term and Category for general sentiment (expressed as ""Love it!!!""):** Two agents directly associate ""Love it!!!"" with the aspect ""general satisfaction"" under ""laptop general."" The strong positive sentiment expressed is consistent, with a score of 5 across agents.

4. **Aspect Term and Category for ""price"":** The price aspect is consistently identified with cross-reference under its category ""laptop price."" The consensus on the opinion term ""good price"" and its sentiment aligns with the scoring conducted by the agents.

Overall, disputes mainly arose in sentiment intensities, predominantly minor (like slight score differentiations) and one categorization variance for ""size,"" which was resolved by majority agreement."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Categories:**
   - The first aspect identified is the ""mac laptop"" with the opinion on the lack of ""no cdrom,"" categorized under ""laptop general"" with a slightly negative sentiment aligning with the result from LLM Agent 3.
   - The second aspect is ""compatibility,"" shared across the agents, related to the operation performance of the optical drive, thus fitting under ""optical_drives operation_performance."" This conclusion is drawn since the context related to an external drive for a laptop without a cdrom is typical for optical drive compatibility issues and resolved positively.

2. **Opinion Term:**
   - ""No cdrom"" reflects a slightly negative aspect concerning the mac laptop without an integrated cd drive, necessitating the acquisition of an external drive.
   - ""Yessss,"" and ""works great!!!"" signifies positive feedback on compatibility after initial apprehension.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:**
   - The negative mention regarding the absence of a cdrom drive in the laptop reflects minimal inconvenience or deficit, thus a slight negative score of -1.
   - The strong positive sentiment and assurance expressed toward the compatibility of an external solution, despite initial apprehension, scores a high positive intensity of 4."

**Explanation:**
1. **Aspect ""macbook"" in ""near mint condition""**: All agents identified this aspect. Agents 2 and 3 rated it as a moderate positive sentiment. This is reflected in the final score of 2. The category ""laptop quality"" is selected by Agent 1 and 2, showing consensus.

2. **Aspect ""box"" with opinion ""a little banged up""**: There’s consensus on the negative sentiment, but Agents 1 and 2 categorize it as affecting ""shipping quality."" Hence, a slightly negative score with the category of ""shipping quality.""

3. **Aspect ""surface"" with opinions ""almost flawless, very light blemishes""**: Agents noted both a slight positive sentiment from ""almost flawless"" and slight negatives from ""blemishes."" The overall sentiment is slightly positive (average). Consistency found in ""laptop quality.""

4. **Aspect ""keyboard"":** Identified by Agent 1 with negative sentiment due to the ""smudge,"" which is consistently assigned to ""keyboard quality"" with slight negativity.

5. **Aspect ""laptop"" in ""everything looks great""**: Final sentiment seen as enthusiastic positive from all agents, with an emphasis on ""laptop quality"" seen broadly by Agent 3. This yields a strong positive score of 4."

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**

Upon analyzing the outputs from the three LLM agents, the consolidated results have been formed by selecting the most consistent and comprehensive elements across the agents' interpretations. The analysis revealed that the laptop has several negative design and usability issues, particularly with the touchpad, front corners, and its fingerprint-attracting surface. These elements have been associated with strong negative opinions and design feature categories. The backlit keyboard and battery operation performance also exhibit negativity, primarily due to inadequate battery life and keyboard settings. The category of price has been consistently viewed negatively due to the laptop not meeting the expectations tied to its high cost."

303,"I had to buy this for my daughter's middle school.  I would have preferred to get an iPad but they decided on a Chromebook.  Oh Well.  This computer lasted approximately 7 months (almost to the end of the school year by not quite).  At a cost of $300 I would have expected more durability especially given that this item is expected to be used daily at school by kids.  This Chromebook lasted longer than most, almost half the students in her class had to replace or fix theirs after 3 months of use.  Just Horrible!!!  In sharp contrast, my son has been using an iPad, daily, at middle school and high school, for the past 4 years and still works as well as the first day we got it.  It speaks to the quality of the item.  I actually paid a little more for this Toshiba because I thought if I spent the money it would be built better.","```json

**Rationale:**
- Group 1: Combined the overlapping observations from all agents concerning the functionality issues with the product after two weeks. The aspect terms like ""product functionality"" and ""it"" were unified under ""product functionality"", with a negative sentiment and a higher intensity score of -4, based on the stronger consensus from multiple agents.
- Group 2: For the purchase advice, ""purchase advice"" was chosen as the aspect term. All agents' insights regarding the price-related advice were consolidated, leading to a negative sentiment with an intensity score of -5, reflecting the strong discouragement from buying.
- Group 3: Inconsistencies in the categorization of the screen feature were reconciled based on similar observations by multiple agents. The conclusion reflects a negative sentiment due to the screen issue, aligned with the sentiment polarity and intensity score more commonly assigned by the agents."

### Explanation:
1. **Aspect Term ""product""**: The sentiment is consistently ""positive"" across all agents, and most frequently associated with ""laptop general"" and ""laptop quality"".
   
2. **Aspect Term ""cord""**: There's agreement among the agents regarding the negative sentiment due to the cord's short length. The most fitting category is ""power_supply design_features"", reflecting the functional implications of design.

3. **Aspect Term ""price""**: All agents recognize the sentiment as positive with a strong intensity related to the value, categorizing it under ""laptop price."" 

4. **Consistent Opinion Terms and Intensities**: Consistencies across agents in specific opinion terms (""ridiculously short"", ""uncomfortably chained"", ""great price"") validate the sentiment intensities applied."

**Explanation:**

1. **General Experience:** While this aspect was only identified by Agent 3, it reflects an important part of the input text. We consolidate it as a separate group as it provides a significant part of the overall sentiment.

2. **Sound Aspect:** The aspect term ""sound"" is chosen as it's common between Agents 1 and 2, with a consistent sentiment and category. We choose ""multimedia_devices general"" as the category, found in both Agent 1 and Agent 3's results.

3. **Portability Aspect:** The term ""Perfect"" is a shared opinion term for the aspect ""portability"" across all agents, with consistent category and sentiment.

4. **Battery Life Aspect:** The aspect term ""battery life"" and its opinion term, sentiment, and category were agreed upon by all agents, with a balanced intensity score choice of 4 from the common finding."
309,"I got this to catch a problem neighbor trespassing outdoors.  I'm putting it up under my eaves.  I like the quality of the video even in very low light.  The onboard battery doesn't really last long so you need AC available and if you plug it in and can't get any video output reverse the red and yellow plugs on your tv---mine is switched someplace probably on the camera itself but it's no big problem because it works. You have to have a TV with RCA/F jacks to enter the setup of this unit. This thing is not cheap but it's about the cheapest unit of its type that you can find anyplace and some places charge a whole bunch more for this than amazon does.  This unit does not support SDHC only SD so your card is limited to 2 gig which is actually quite a lot of video recording.  You can plug this into your computer and windows sees it with the mass storage driver or you can pull the card out and plug it into any reader to play the videos; you can view files on a computer but you can't enter the setup except with a TV set.

I would have preferred they make it a little more weather resistant but those seemed to cost more.  This looks like a motion detector for a outdoor light, I'm going to hang it up under my eaves to watch my driveway area, it should be ok there and protected from the elements I just have to hope stupid doesn't figure out what it is and take the card out of it because it's pretty obvious what this is when you're up close to it.","```json

**Rationale:**

- For ""computer"" in the first sentence, both neutral sentiment from LLM 1 and LLM 3 were retained.
- For ""quality,"" there was a consensus among all three agents on strong negative sentiment and an intensity of -5.
- The ""keyboard"" aspect was classified under ""design_features"" given agreement from LLM 1 and LLM 3, with a negative sentiment and intensity score of -2.
- The phrase ""it will not even turn on"" referred to the ""computer"" under ""operation_performance"" with a strong negative sentiment of -4 from both LLM 1 and LLM 3.
- For the final opinion, the dissatisfaction was associated with the overall experience, aligned with the generalized negative sentiment towards the purchase process, retaining the category from LLM 1 with an adjusted intensity score from LLM 2 and LLM 3."

**Reconciliation and Justification:**
1. **Software Issue:**

2. **Unit Issue:**
   - Two agents identify ""unit"" issues with similar sentiment and category assignments. Merging results, the decision was made for ""laptop operation_performance"" with the intensity reflected as -3.

3. **Product Readiness:**
   - All agents indicate the overall dissatisfaction with the ""product"" readiness, assigning it to ""laptop general"" with consistent negative sentiment. Intensity averaged at -3. 

4. **Overall Product Sentiment:**
   - An additional aspect, overall product sentiment, was noted with strong dissatisfaction and intensity at -4, classified under ""laptop general"". This captures the initial expression of disappointment from Agent 3’s analysis."

327,"ive had these speakers for a couple weeks now and i will say these are the best speakers for people who cant really afford high end amps,but still want clear and loud mid range sounds from four speakers.

let me explain in more detail i had the Pioneer TS-A6994R A-Series 6""x9"" 5-Way 600 Watts with the Pioneer TS-A1684R A-Series 6 1/2"" 4-Way 350 Watts they were powered by the Alpine MRP-F300 - Amplifier - V-Power - 4-channel. i had no clue how power hungry the pioneer 6 x9's were so of course my little alpine amp could not handle it and i couldn't afford a better 4 channel amp with more watts. and thus my music suffered because of it. and to top that the 6x9s had way too much bass because i already had a sub woofer in the back so it would sound weird sometimes were the bass would drown out allot of the voice.

With all that said i bought these speakers and yes they have little to no bass, this is a fact. but if you already have a sub woofer and a weak amp these speakers are amazing, the alpine amp matches perfectly with these speakers because they do not need much power, and due to the fact that they have little to no bass they hit the highs and mids pretty well.

my system sounds wayyyy and i repeat wayyyy better with these speakers, so if you have a sub woofer and a weak but high quality amp like the alpine i have these speakers are really the best and one the cheapest options out there.

P.S these puppies can take allot of damage as well like some other people are saying, i have put them on full blast for along time and they have not been blown or damaged in any way, great speakers for the money","```json

It has seen a lot of wear and I have been wanting to clean it up for sometime, so I found this Tech Armor cleaning kit and decided to try it out! All I can say is it's AMAZING! It has cleaned up my screen, keyboard, hand rest areas and entire shell thoroughly, I mean the laptop looks almost brand new again! I am pleasantly surprised and happy with the purchase!

The Samsung software that came with the drive cloned my old dying hard drive perfectly in about 3 hours and the new drive plugged right in. The new drive makes my old Dell D630 laptop with SATA2/USB2 waaay faster than it ever was. It's faster than the new Dell I have at work, which has a better CPU, SATA 3 and USB 3 but with a standard HDD. The Samsung SSD is so fast the old CPU in the old Dell is working harder to keep up with it. I don't have benchmark numbers but the speed increase is dramatic for what I have to do. Everything loads very fast now and the computer boots in 15 seconds rather than a minute+ as it used to.  I love it, am planning to get another one for myn wife's Dell D620 laptop,  and have already recommended this Samsung SSD to many others.","```json

In reaching the final output, I consolidated findings from all three agents:

1. The overall sentiment for the laptop is consistently positive, with sentiments agreeing on the ""Pretty Good"" expression, and is categorized as ""laptop general.""

2. Confusion over the hard disc (HD) resulted in assigning a strong negative sentiment due to the ""bad"" and ""extremely slowwwwww"" opinions, categorized as ""hard_disc quality"". This recognizes both the adjective (""bad"") and the performance-related issue (""extremely slowwwwww"") connected to the problematic HD.

3. The sentiment on the replacement with an SSD is positive across all agents and is consistently related to its performance, classified confidently as ""hard_disc operation_performance"" at an intensity of 4.

I have aligned these outputs to ensure consistency and coherence while recognizing differing interpretations from the agents' analyses."

345,"I ordered the Pyle voltasse converter on Sunday (09/17/17) and received it yesterday (09/19/17). Today (09/20/17) I tried to use it.
It doesn't work!!! I followed the intructions and tried to turn on a coffee machine 220v, however, it has burned the fuse for 3 times.
It is clear to me that it is not working how it should.
I'd like to change the product. How can I do it?
Thank you!

### Explanation:

1. **On-Screen Keyboard Issues**: 
   - The agents generally agree on the negative sentiment towards the on-screen keyboard operation, primarily due to it popping up unexpectedly. The consensus intensity score is -3, reflecting a strong negative sentiment regarding its malfunction.

2. **Sharkk Support**:
   - The evaluation of support was neutral as the remark about hoping for a solution does not express a definitive positive or negative experience with Sharkk support.

3. **Improvement with Keyboard Issue**:
   - Some improvement in the keyboard popping up was noted, settling on a neutral sentiment as there was no explicit satisfaction or dissatisfaction following the update.

4. **Bracket Damage**:
   - Consistently marked negative due to the presence of a ""broken piece,"" with a sentiment intensity score of -3 showing concern but functionality still being somewhat retained.

5. **Overall Liking**:
   - Positive sentiment towards ""everything"" was captured, as one agent noted this explicitly, adding a positive dimension to the overall user experience. The sentiment intensity score is 2, reflecting a moderate positive feeling towards the product as a whole."

I like the touch screen interface, although sometimes it does not respond when scrolling up or down.  I put a screen protector for a cell phone on the product to protect the touch screen. The player sometimes shuts off unexpectedly, and then won't turn on until you connect it the the USB port on the computer to ""reset"" it.

The good news is the warranty is one year, so I'll call tech support at 580-272-0035 and have it replaced.  I'll give an update on the new unit, if the new unit does the same thing I would recommend not buy this product.  The file formats that I used were WMA, MP3.

**Explanation:**
1. **Group 1:** There is consensus among the agents that the heat issue and usability problems relate to the laptop's operation performance. The opinion terms ""real hot real fast"" and ""not usable at all"" are primarily derived from agent 1, with intensity scores aligning at -4 across the board.

2. **Group 2:** There's agreement on the negative sentiment towards the experience expressed by ""very disappointed!!!"" The sentiment here is agreed upon as reflecting a strong negative experience related to the company's general service.

3. **Group 3:** The term ""fire hazard"" is consistently seen as a critical issue linked to the quality of the laptop. Agent 3's categorization as ""laptop quality"" is most appropriate since it aligns with the underlying concern about the product potentially being a fire hazard, and the sentiment intensity score is consistently -5.

Overall, the ABSA results are synthesized from the strongest points of consensus across the agents, ensuring consistency in aspect term interpretation, opinion extraction, sentiment polarity, and intensity scoring."

- The intensity of -5 is agreed upon by its unanimous negative sentiment in all agents with phrases like ""doesn't even work,"" and ""Piece of crap!!!"".
- ""rating"" was categorized as ""out_of_scope general"" by all agents with consistent sentiment and intensity."

365,"I just unboxed it and it installed flawlessly in my computer.
It comes with a USB power adaptor to power the card, if necessary.

It worked fine with a Iphone 4s that I installed and charged it.

Than I decided to connect a 8 port USB 2 Hub to it with multiple devices and
a Microsoft LifeCam Camera. Other devices ran fine.

The camera was very flickery. I decided to reboot my machine and while closing down saw the
dreaded BSOD. Rebooted and camera still ran flickery.

I searched the internet for updated drivers and ran across this site station-drivers.com/page/renesas.
for drivers, t add the [...] and the www to it and at the end a htm

But I couldn't figure out how to update the driver. The camera is a known problem.
I'll be happy if I can hook a USB 3 device or hub to it and realize faster speeds. I can always directly plug the camera into the
computer.
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
I'll be doing a backup directly with a USB drive and time the speeds and see if it's stable.
Check back when that is done

370,"I wanted to love the Tablo but ultimately I returned it.  TIP: I wasted an hour on incorrect directions in the packaging.  It says in the quick setup to connect a hard drive, connect (wired) to the network and then connect to power.  It then instructs you to locate Tablo on your WIFI network to connect and configure.  HERE IS WHAT IS WRONG - if you connect the Tablo unit to the network via a network cable Tablo will turn off its internal WIFI.  This means it will NEVER display on your WIFI network and you can't configure the Tablo unit as instructed.  SOOOO.... don't connect Tablo to your network via a network cable when you are first setting it up!  Or alternatively use a Windows computer, running Chrome web browser to find and configure the Tablo unit if it is connected via Internet cable to your network (that is how I found it - not via WIFI).

The Good: It has a first rate program menu and interface.  It's worth $5/month for it.  It is easy to setup and configure (except for the tip I posted as first).  It does a good job reliably recording shows.  (With good WIFI signal strength) It streams shows well to my tablets and Windows 7 laptop.

Why I Returned It: The Tablo App is not ready for prime time.  As is, the App is good for watching recorded Tablo shows on your android tablet BUT is horrible at projecting it via Chromecast to your TV.  It lags, its buggy and it's prone to crashing.  With my laptop, it works well with Chromecast BUT I didn't buy this to have my laptop sitting on my lap to watch TV.  If that were the case I'd simply plug in an HDMI cable and stream the shows from the TV channel sites.

THEY ARE SOOOOO CLOSE... but not there yet.  Compare their app's chromecast capabilities to Netflix or Huluplus and you'll understand how far behind they are.  NOTE this was in Nov 2014 that I had used the unit and app.  Maybe it's been improved by the time you read this.","```json

**Rationale for Consolidation:**
- **Aspect Term & Opinion Term:** All agents agreed on the key aspect terms and related opinion terms, ensuring consistency.
- **Sentiment Polarity:** There was broad agreement on the sentiment polarity for each aspect term; any differences were minor or isolated to single agent interpretations.
- **Sentiment Intensity Score:** Where there was a discrepancy (e.g., scores of 3 vs. 4 for 'product'), a median score or the most common score was chosen, aligning with the overall positive sentiment.
- **Category Assignment:** The final categories were determined based on majority agreement or clearer term alignment in the document context. For instance, 'Bluetooth capability' aligns with 'multimedia_devices connectivity' as supported by the consensus in agent outputs."

It was crucial in preventing electronic damage during power outages (""would have fried""), reflecting a positive sentiment with intensity score 4.

2. **Aspect Term: ""price""** - All agents agreed on a strongly positive sentiment regarding the price being the best in various contexts, which has been consolidated with an intensity score 5.

3. **Aspect Term: ""Amazon.com""** - Refers to the company aspect concerning price, also highlighting strongly positive sentiment for offering the best prices (""best prices"", ""products!!!!""). Intensity score reinforced as 5, aligning with all agents but prioritizing the sentiment towards the company's offering of good prices as opposed to general product experience."
381,"BATTERIES: With fairly heavy use for about ten nights, the original AAA batteries (not supplied, if I recall correctly) are still going strong. Some reviewers have noted other headsets go through batteries rapidly. This takes 2 AAAs in the headset and another 2 in the base (transmitter).
RANGE: The base only needs to be on when the headset's built-in FM tuner is not the mode being used. Using FM you can walk literally anywhere with these on -- across the street (though I wouldn't since I don't know anyone there), across town, heck hop a plane! I haven't had a problem, though mostly using them in the house, mainly for FM reception.

**Reconciliation and Justification:**

1. **""ASUS Chromebook"" Aspect Term:**
   - Consistent agreement on ""ASUS Chromebook"" being adored, with strong intensity matches in the opinions ""WOW"" and ""LOVE IT!"". All three agents mostly agreed on categorizing it under ""laptop general"", and the consensus intensity was 5.

2. **""Setup"" Aspect Term:**
   - While the exact terminology varied slightly (""setup"", ""set up"", ""setup process""), the sentiment and its strength were consistently positive. Given the dominant agreement on usability, it was categorized under ""laptop usability"" with a slightly higher intensity of 4, in line with the prevalent sentiment.

3. **""Price"" Aspect Term:**
   - The consistent choice of the aspect ""price"" and the opinion ""What a deal"" received similarly moderate positive sentiment, leading to a category of ""laptop price"" with an intensity score of 3, representing a strong yet median sentiment among the agents.

4. **""Recommendation"" Aspect Term:**
   - There was a divergence in interpretation, but considering the implied positive context and gratitude towards the recommendation, it was placed under ""support general"". The intensity was toned to 2 to reflect the acknowledgment of appreciation without strong emotional expression."

**Rationale for Consolidation:**

1. **Price Aspect Term:**
    - Both 'skeptical' and 'too good' are combined in Agent 1 and Agent 3, both relate to the price aspect. Despite Agent 3 having a negative sentiment, Agent 1 and Agent 2 agree on a positive sentiment with moderate intensity, reflecting overall satisfaction with the price.

2. **Quality Aspect Term:**
    - All three agents recognized the quality aspect as positive. The sentiment intensity varies, but the general agreement is to place a strong positive sentiment (Agent 1's intense positivity of 5 is reconciled to 4, balancing the strength across agents).

3. **Matching Stylus and Screen Protector Aspect Term:**
    - The stylus and screen protector, treated initially as separate in Agent 1 but combined as one aspect in Agent 2 and given neutral sentiment. This consolidation is logical, as there are no strong positive or negative sentiments.

4. **Shipping Aspect Term:**
    - Across agents, shipping has been consistently recognized as positive with different facets considered (Agent 1 focuses on pricing, Agent 2 on timing). This nuance is reconciled to reflect a positive sentiment on operation performance across sentiments.

5. **iPad/Rotation Aspect Term:**
    - All agents identified the rotating iPad as a separate usability factor with positive sentiment. Agent 2 indicates design features while Agent 3 emphasizes usability. Given the nature of rotation affecting usability, the consolidated evaluation respects this aspect category while maintaining strong sentiment intensity."

**Conclusion to reconcile differences:**

1. All agents acknowledge the negative sentiment regarding the ""product."" However:
   - Agents 1 and 3 categorize it as ""laptop general.""
   - Agent 2 splits between ""company quality"" and ""company operation_performance.""

2. Given the nature of the text mainly discussing the overall product dissatisfaction, ""laptop general"" from Agent 1 and 3 is deemed a suitable category to consolidate all results. The ""return"" and ""rating"" from Agent 2 reflect operational dissatisfaction fitting under general product perception.

3. Intensity scores from all agents align at -5, indicating a strong negative consensus.

4. The aspects are distilled to focus on the product as the main subject of critique, encapsulating the overarching issues expressed."

**Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category:** I consolidated aspect terms based on the majority consensus among agents. For group 1, although terms like ""durability"" and ""power"" were suggested, ""laptop"" emerged as the agreed term, focusing on ""quality"" as the predominant aspect category.
   
2. **Sentiment Intensity Score:** For the sentences where agreement was already strong regarding negative experiences with clear descriptions of issues, a score of -5 is maintained (group 1 and group 4) to reflect a high-intensity sentiment as described across agents.

3. **Handling Differences:** For the aspect in group 2, ""Useless and a wast of money!!"" is placed under ""laptop price."" Despite varying interpretations, this best captures the sentiment's intent across agents and includes specific opinion phrases consistent in expressing disappointment regarding value.

4. **Specificity and Consistency:** I ensured that opinions and sentiments are cohesive, drawing on multiple agent insights, particularly emphasizing the acute negative experiences entwined with quality and monetary aspects.

**Explanation:**
- **Group 1:** The aspect term ""product"" is identified consistently across all three agents, with the opinion term ""Horrible"" being the common identifying opinion. The category ""battery operation_performance"" was chosen as the consensus since it was marked by two agents. The negative intensity score of -4 is unanimously agreed upon.
  
- **Group 2:** The aspect term ""replacement"" is identified across all outputs. The opinion ""doesn't work"" is consistently noted. The sentiment intensity score of -3 is agreed upon. The category that fits best considering multiple interpretations of operation issues with the replacement is ""company operation_performance,"" since it reflects service and replacement functionality concerns, which one LLM agent and the ABSA task suggest.

- **Group 3:** The aspect term ""money"" with sentiment phrases revolving around waste is uniformly recognized with the highest negative intensity of -5. The category ""laptop price"" emerges as the most accurate as the issue primarily addresses the cost and perceived value of the product across the majority of the agent results."

### Reconciliation Explanation:
- **Aspect Term for Lighting**: All agents identified ""lighting,"" though one emphasized ""purchased""; we focus on ""lighting.""
- **Energy Supply Category**: Used ""battery operation_performance"" as mentioned by Agent 3, aligning with its purpose in the context.
- **LED Strip Lighting**: Despite varied categories, the consensus on sentiment and opinion is retained; the agreed intensity score is 2.
- **Censors/Sensors**: The term was corrected where needed. Agent 2's category seemed misplaced; consensus keeps it as ""out_of_scope general.""
- **Stock**: Category ""out_of_scope general"" used due to its consistency across analyses emphasizing product availability. 

All the other aspects, opinions, sentiments, and their intensities were largely agreed upon and maintained as is per the collected outputs, ensuring the most balanced representation of the initial analyses.

### Explanation:

1. **Aspect Term 'memory modular':**  
   All agents agree on the aspect term, sentiment polarity, opinion term, sentiment intensity score, and category. Therefore, the consensus is maintained.

2. **Aspect Term 'older laptop':**  
   Agents 1 and 2 detected the ""older laptop"" as part of the neutral statement regarding upgrading, while differing slightly in terms of aspect and opinion. However, the sentiment remains neutral with a score of 0. The category is universally identified as ""laptop general.""

3. **Aspect of Performance 'laptop':**  
   Agents 1 and 3 associate strong positive sentiment with how the upgraded laptop functions. The categorization as ""laptop operation_performance"" aligns well with the observed sentiments ""more than grateful"" and ""fine tuned watch."" Thus, reflective opinion terms and positive intensity of 4 are used.

The consolidation respects the observations from each agent, ensuring consistent aspect identification, opinion assessment, sentiment polarity, and intensity scores. This provides a robust final assessment that captures the document's overall sentiment and aspect descriptions."

#### Explanation:

1. **Laptop Quality:**
   - All agents agree that there are significant issues with the product's performance and reliability, emphasizing phrases like ""stopped working,"" ""a week!!!!,"" and ""shut off.""
   - Sentiment is consistently negative across the agents, and the negative sentiment intensity score ranges from -4 to -5. Agent 1's scoring of -5 is taken for its intensity alignment with the textual expressions of strong dissatisfaction.

2. **Price Discontent:**
   - While there are slight discrepancies in categorization among the agents (laptop vs. company focus), Agents 1 and 2 align on the sentiment related to price discontent.
   - The sentiment is strongly negative with -4 being the most consistent score assigned which reflects the dissatisfaction with the pricing vis-a-vis the product quality (""this crap"").

3. **HDMI Cable Quality:**
   - All agents cite select phrases indicating satisfaction with the HDMI cable's functionality.
   - Sentiment is positive, and most agents assign a sentiment intensity score of 4, stretching to 3 in some interpretations but captured accurately at 4 owing to consistent positive feedback (""works great"").

The final reconciled conclusion takes into account comprehensive views from the three agents, ensuring a clear, integrated understanding of the sentiment expressed for each identified aspect."
415,"If you are like me and lurking around the reviews to make the call of buying this when its selling for $98, I say you go ahead and do it.
But don't expect tooooo much from this headphone, because of all the reviews I had my expectation set at very high level and it didn't match that anyway.

But i love that headphones anyway, it serves my needs of a wireless headphones for when I am in office and now I can also watch movies at night without waking the wifey.
I have a slightly large head and these fit nicely and are comfortable for hours. To all the Mac users, it works perfectly with my MBP Pro and Mac Mini.

I am no expert in audio stuffs and don't get terms highs, lows, miss etc. but I can tell you this, the bass booster is overkill sometimes. I always keep it off. It becomes too noisy if its on. If you are looking for crisp and clear sounds this might not be a good choice.","```

421,"Even at the brightest setting, this screen is 25% dimmer than the Hp 2133.  Also note that it comes with IE6 installed, and the unusual screen size re the weird driver setup causes some web pages to go bonkers (huge text).  Going to IE7 or Firefox solves this.

The keyboard is almost unusable, of course.

The Pros are the small size and weight.

See my review of the Hp 2133 and the critical problem it has with the Via chipset.

My conclusion, this machine is, for a secondary, going to meeting type of machine, the better of the two.  If HP changes the VIA to an Intel chip, there is absolutely no question that the ASUS would be inferior.  Note, however, that the ASUS does OK on its 4 cell...and the HP is somewhat bigger and about 60% heavier (the souped up model is well over 3 lbs, despite the adverts).

<<<<<< Update June 7 >>>>>>

Asus has just demonstrated the eee PC 1000.  It has 7 hours of battery life, a larger keyboard, and is about 1.75 inches wider.

Using the Atom chipset (as does the 901) it looks promising.  Initial pricing estimates put it near the Hp 2133 at $750, however.  I saw the 901 takes a ca. $80 price hike over the 900.","```json

It is a bit heavy than currently available laptops, but it is okay because it has metal body, and it really looks good quality and premium design, it looks different and really good as compare to other laptops available under $600...

Graphics and performance is really good,, I did play ""Battlefield 3"" on full HD with high graphics on, but still it don't get hot, but lil bit over warm and very quite cooling fan, So I guess I don't need to explain anything else regarding performance.

""beats audio"" is too overrated, my old compaq cq50 sounds way laud and clear than new HP with beats audio.

USB 3.0 works fine, way faster than usb2.0...
Fingerprint reader doesn't work for me (usually too much sweat on my fingers, sometimes it works and it has cool feature, you can register fingerprint and use it to login your emails without typing username and password.

Have to get use to of this kind of keypad and touchpad,,,, its not at all bad but old one is really good, so it will take some time to get used to it.. multitouch is not so good as windows does not have good software to work with that but still sometime it is useful....

battery life duration changes depends on how you use it,,, but runs longer than 3 hours on full charge on average/mid settings..

overall, it is a good one, no regrets,,, so many of my friend who spent more than $700, they can not believe that this one is under $500 (because it looks premium quality and performs good too)","```json

430,"Wellll since they sent me an email for a review here I am.  I received this product with a broken plastic clip on one of the plugs (other one was fine).  Didn't notice untillllll - I went to plug it in and it came right out - how nice.  Sooooo when you put it into the jack it won't stay with even the slightest hint of movement against the cable, so had to cut and shove some of that tie wrap they used to bundle up the cable for shipping, and shove that into the jack slot where the tab would have ordinarily clicked in to lock the cable into the jack in order to keep it more snug and from falling out.  My expectation is that it, the product, would be fully functioning upon arrival, so I was disappointed.  The plastic tabs are easy to break in handling, but still.  Will that happen to you if you order... I dunno.","```json

In the consolidated response, the aspect terms and opinion terms have been aligned with the closest interpretations from all agents, ensuring consistency in aspect categorization and sentiment scoring. Some agent interpretations that introduced subjective misconceptions (e.g., ""how nice"" as positive) were not considered due to the argument's overall negative context. The selected categories reflect a consensus when possible, with compromise based on the preponderance of evidence from the various agents' analyses."

**Justification:**

1. **Aspect Term (Group 1 - Sound):** All agents recognize the aspect related to the ""sound"" or ""radio"" generally, but differ slightly in sentiment. Overall, ""good"" is counterbalanced by ""Not remotely,"" leading to a neutral sentiment, aligning best with Agent 1 and Agent 3’s assessment.

2. **Aspect Term (Group 2 - Price):** Clear consensus on the term ""Bose system"" or ""price,"" with a common negative sentiment due to the phrase ""waaaay over-priced."" The choice of aspect term ""Bose system"" is more specific, but price remains the focus.

3. **Aspect Term (Group 3 - Internet Radio):** True convergence across agents on ""Internet radio"" or connectivity issues, with negative sentiment. Slight variation in opinion terms implicates consistent discontent about connection abilities, aligning with Agent 1.

4. **Aspect Term (Group 4 - Customer Support):** Uniform recognition of sentiment on ""customer support"" as being extremely negative.

5. **Aspect Term (Group 5 - Purchase):** Acknowledges negative sentiment towards the purchase itself. Varied category placements (either out_of_scope or company price) indicate recognizing dissatisfaction with the cost or outcome, choosing ""company price"" synthesizes broader negative financial sentiment."

**Consolidation Explanation:**
1. **Group 1:** 
   - Aspect ""computer"" is consistently categorized under ""laptop general"" by Agents 1 and 3 with a positive sentiment, contrary to the neutral sentiment by Agent 2. The conclusion aligns with the majority and the sentiment intensity score is averaged at ""2"".

2. **Group 2:**
   - Aspect ""Windows 8"" was sometimes categorized differently by Agents. However, the dominating sentiment is ""neutral"", and ""trying to adjust"" indicates a difficulty without overt negativity. Selected category ""os general"" as Agent 1's assessment often is the most accurate on the specific ""adjustment"" process.

3. **Group 3:**
   - Aspect ""HP"" aligns on being negative with majority categorizing the performance or quality issues under ""company general"". Given this consensus, the category reflected was derived from Agents 1 and 3.

4. **Group 4:**
   - Aspect ""computer"" was listed as positive in terms of ""fans&cooling operation_performance"", aligned with Agent 1's and Agent 3's assessment with a positive evaluative sentiment concerning temperature, which underlines cooling performance. The consensus matched on positive feedback with involuntary exclamation agreement in LLM Agents' results, warranting an intensity of ""3""."

### Explanation:

- **Aspect 1 (Laptop General & Reviews)**: Despite varying chosen aspect terms, all agents agree on a negative sentiment about the laptop's general experience as influenced by initial reviews; therefore, a consolidated sentiment is captured as negative.

- **Aspect 2 (Space Bar)**: Consensus among agents about the neutral experience with the space bar that has both functional difficulties and some improvement upon intervention; thus, the category and sentiment are consolidated accordingly.

- **Aspect 3 (Mousepad)**: The loud mousepad was consistently noted across agents, justifying a negative sentiment.

- **Aspect 4 (Screen)**: Positive consensus across agents about the matte screen.

- **Aspect 5 (Battery)**: While aspects like weight and speed were noted separately, the impactful sentiment about the battery was consistent among two agents, resulting in a positive sentiment for battery performance.

- **Aspect 6 (Speakers)**: All agents cited a negative sentiment towards the speaker quality.

- **Aspect 7 (Troubleshooting Experience)**: Acknowledging the need for troubleshooting was marked by a negative sentiment by most agents.

- **Aspect 8 (Usability for Writing/Surfing)**: Given varying comments about its usability contextually, a mixed sentiment was determined appropriate for final consistency.

- **Aspect 9 (Purchase Decision and Value)**: Negativity regarding the purchase decision and related price value universally emerged across agents, capturing sentiment consistency in this decision."

453,"For a pinpoint stylus, it's alright i guess. Sometimes it doesn't register on my ASUS TP500LA Touchscreen laptop when I am trying to scroll or hit buttons. That can become annoying for someone that is trying to work fast. But it works fantastically on my Sony Xperia Z Ultra Smartphone. The nib also sort of sticks on the glass of my laptop and can make it difficult to draw notes in OneNote. I have been using a hard nib point, I haven't tried the soft nib point, so my experience might be completely different if I was using a soft nib. Also, the auto-off feature after like 20-30 minutes can be irritating if you plan to have it on while sitting in a meeting or class. I think you can get past it by clicking the power button every now and then, but that hasn't been proven by me yet.  BUT! The pen is rechargeable via microUSB, which is FANTASTIC! No AAAA batteries that you have to replace every week or so. Also, when its not missing recognition, it is very accurate, which I can't say the same using your finger or a broad tip stylus. I got this pen cheaper on another website, which was a better price than what they are selling it here. So if you can find it cheaper, I would recommend it.","```json

**Final Conclusion:**
1. **Aspect Term & Category for Sound Quality:** Across all agents, the aspect term ""sound quality"" was consistently identified. Agents 2 and 3 agreed on the category as ""multimedia_devices quality"". Considering their agreement and relevance, the category selected is ""multimedia_devices quality"".

2. **Sentiment Analysis for Sound Quality:** The sentiment polarity for ""sound quality"" was unanimously positive among the agents, with the intensity scores of 4 (Agents 2 and 3) and 5 (Agent 1). A moderate consensus on strong positive is reached. An average intensity score of 4.5 is determined.

3. **Aspect Term & Category for Setup Process:** Discrepancies were found in the phrasing of the aspect term (Agent 1: ""set up"", Agent 3: ""setup process""). The term ""setup process"" is selected as it is more comprehensive. Categories varied from ""out_of_scope general"" and ""software usability"" to ""multimedia_devices usability"". Given the context of a wireless speaker setup, ""multimedia_devices usability"" is most fitting.

2nd, I did not take a star away because I can deal with the set up. Their software is not that easy to maneuver you may need to call customer service for help unless you are a computer geek. Besides their customer service is based in the Philippines and it's kind of difficult to understand because of their accents.
3rd, DLink customer service acknowledged that they have problem with its 4G connectivity, meaning YOU CAN ONLY VIEW FREEZE PICTURE AND NOT VIDEO. I tried everything and it is NIL.  They said they are working on the 4G problems but since last year? Hmmmm  So, that's taken one star away.
4th, if you try to monitor outside activity from behind a window. It is OK if during daylight but not at a dark environment because infrared lights will reflect on the glass and gives you the glares that completely not viewable. That's one star taken away because it doesn't serve the purpose. BTW, it is black and white video at dark environment.

### Rationale:

1. **Delivery Aspect:**
   - Consensus was found on the aspect term ""delivery"" and opinion term ""on time"" indicating positive sentiment with agreed sentiment polarity. An intensity score of 2 was chosen as a balanced reflection between the scores given by agent 1 and 3.

2. **Performance Aspect:**
   - While agents 1 and 2 varied on the categories (""laptop operation_performance"" vs. ""hardware operation_performance""), agent 3 also shared the overlapping aspect of ""performance,"" leaning towards ""hardware operation_performance."" The intensity score is set at 3 as a balanced conclusion among the varied scores.

3. **Sound Aspect:**
   - The sound aspect mentioned in all agent responses had varying opinions from ""surprises me"" to ""sooooo much better."" The consensus was reached for ""multimedia_devices operation_performance” with strong positive sentiment; thus, an intensity score of 4 was deemed appropriate.

4. **Speakers Aspect:**
   - Multiple agents identified the ""speakers"" quality and agreed on the opinion ""sooooo much better,"" with consistent positive sentiment across analyses. An intensity score of 4 represents the strong positive sentiment observed by agents 2 and 3."
463,"MBP users should know that while this product is a perfect size for the 15"" model and it definitely keeps your laptop cooler, there is an issue.  The design of the USB connection has the cord attached at the back.  In order to make sure that it doesn't block your power connection, you must bend the USB cord waaay down.  There is still danger of your power connection not being completely in contact as it should be.  Also, with the short length of the coolpad's USB power connector, there isn't an option to plug it in on the other side of your MBP.

O, and if you plan to use this on your lap, look first at the contours of the bottom.  Although the large feet make a great base on a hard surface, you may want to use a lapboard or something similar between the plastic edges of the bottom surface and your legs.

Even with the minor issues (after fiddling with it a bit and getting things settled in) I am very happy with this product. It does the trick with my MBP, even when I play WoW.","```json

**Justification:**
- For the ""adapter cord"", Agent 1 and 3 identified it, noting positive sentiment but differed on intensity. Majority analysis provided a mixed intensity score, thus I averaged them.
- For ""Bluetooth"", varying interpretations occurred across agents, so I harmonized them into a neutral sentiment given agent inconsistencies and context suggests factual motivation.
- Consolidation of ""setup process"" involved recognizing terminological variances (e.g., ""device"", ""setup process"") but consistent strong positivity justified combining these and aligning it under ""multimedia_devices usability"".
- For ""car interface"", Agent 3’s neutral classification factored into an average score with agents 1 and 2's positive inputs.
- ""Thank you!!!"" was noted for overall positive sentiment without specific aspect classification in agents, keeping it under ""out_of_scope general""."

- **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:** All agents agree on a negative sentiment for the frame with varying intensities, and a strong sentiment intensity score (-5) is reasonable given the context and recurring problems indicated in the text.
- **Aspect Term and Category for LCD Viewfinder:** The ""LCD viewfinder"" is positively reviewed, categorized as ""display quality"" across all analyses.
- **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity for LCD Viewfinder:** The sentiment polarity for the LCD viewfinder is positive with an intensity score of 2, consistent with positive interpretations observed in the agents' outputs."

Features I did not like: Cannot View Photos (or even last photo taken) without shutting camera.  Prolonged time from taking of one photo to next (I am talking 20-40 seconds! a lot when you see a photo you like).  Often ""closed"" the front panel when grabbing camera from someone to take a photo, in turn shutting it off.  Red Eye feature: everyone always blinked after it.

476,"Great router. It is dual band, has great features and looks nice.

Lets see, setup is fast, I am advanced user so didn't use the wizzard.

As a router it probably works great. I am however using it as an AP at this time, which is the few bugs I found.

First one is in AP mode you cant set timezone, so set that while in router mode, than put in AP mode. Also in AP mode static IP does not seem to stick all the time jumping back and forth between DHCP and that. For most people not a big deal.

I cant say if it will have issues in router mode as no need for me to use that mode.

My only physical complaint on it is the stand. Wish I could put it the other way as I have a shelf on a wall for it and it sits backwards now.

Speed wise, its FAST.

I was able to transfer at over 19MB/sec from Wifi to a LAN computer and while doing so got full internet speeds and had no problem getting onto router still.

This is a new product so some bugs are expected but the ones I found are minor and should be fixed easy by manufacture, and only seem to be on the AP mode.

***Update 9/18

Just thought I would add I am running a beta firmware .19 they just released and it has not helped in AP mode. I have also learned the 2.4Ghz mode can't keep active connections to devices. The 5Ghz seems fine but found this out the hard way as my xbox is useless.

Netgear support is horrible as always when trying to contact them. It's sad. They have some GREAT employees but the front line is just a mess.

Anyway I have ordered the WNDR4500 and will see if its any better. If it gets here before this one has working FW this goes back. I should also note the 5Ghz range is about 1/5th of the 2.4. It is normal to be less, about half (due to higher freq), but not 1/5th.

**Update 9/23
Still no help from netgear, and a good number of people on forum with issues also.

I now have a WNDR4500 in hand which seems to run better however its got its own issues on the 2.4GHz band it seems also, poor speed and connection, but at least stable and 5GHz is way better vs 3800. I don't see how they release 2 bad products in a row. Most of these issues are with basic usage and should have been caught during testing :(","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1:** 
   - Consistent agreement among the agents for the aspect regarding performance, the positive sentiment, and an intensity score of 4. The aspect term ""performance"" and category ""laptop operation_performance"" are chosen to reflect the majority.

2. **Group 2:**
   - Consolidated separate evaluations regarding ""worth the money"". Some viewed it as related to pricing (Company/Laptop price), and for general agreement, we capture ""company price"" with an opinion captured from Agent 2.

3. **Group 3:**
   - Centers around the delivery and setup efficiency. Some considered it ""neutral"", but combining numerous shorter opinions steadies a positive sentiment with a score of 2.
 
4. **Group 4:**
   - Agreement for the aspect on its value concerning the opinion ""SOOO WORTH IT!!"", maintaining the sentiment ""positive"" and highest intensity score of 5.

The final consolidation reflects the integration of perspectives from all three agents, ensuring that all variations in interpretation are harmonized into a coherent result."

495,I have tried to use this product for an extended period of time.....July to Halloween.  Since it came with no instructions or any paperwork I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong.  I would love to use the keyboard but cannot turn it on.  I think I was able to charge it but after charging it will not turn on.  I have to rate it as okay because it does cover the computer but I would love to use the keyboard that I paid extra to acquire.,"[

**Conclusion Explanation:**

1. **Laptop General:**
   - All agents agree on the aspect term ""laptop"" with the sentiment being ""positive"" and ""simply amazing!!!!"" being a clear opinion ter. Most agents agree on a strong sentiment intensity score of 5 with the category ""laptop general"".

2. **Issues / Quality:**
   - The aspect term ""issues"" is consistently noted by all agents with a positive connotation as there were no issues found, corresponding to positive product quality. Therefore, the category ""laptop quality"" and a ""positive"" polarity with an intensity score of 4 are a combined decision that respects the majority view.

3. **Overall Performance:**
   - Although there are different phrasing of aspect terms (""performance"" and ""works""), the underlying performance being positively evaluated is agreed upon. Sentences imply high performance, hence ""laptop operation_performance"" catoger. A consensus of strong positive sentiment (intensity score 5) is adopted given the overall satisfaction expressed in each analysis."

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**
- The consensus across all agents shows consistent neutral sentiment regarding the ""GB LAN support"", with aspect category agreed to be ""ports connectivity"".
- There is strong agreement on the positive sentiment and high intensity towards ""security protection"" and ""reliability"", under ""software security"" and ""hardware operation_performance"" respectively.
- Despite minor variations in wording, the wireless-related aspects predominantly exhibit negative sentiment. ""Wireless Network"" and ""wireless performance"" both reflect negative opinions (-2 to -4 intensity), with ""laptop operation_performance"" as the recurring category.
- The aspect of ""flexibility"" and ""wireless applications"" varies slightly in scoring but holds consistent ratings within the scope of ""laptop usability"" and ""laptop connectivity.""
- While there is a positive overarching feeling towards ""ALL other aspects of the device"", mostly reflected under ""hardware quality""."

**Justification for Final Decisions:**

1. **Screen (Group 1):** All three agents identified the ""screen"" issues, with specific references to the screen going black and becoming impossible to see. While there was a division between categorizing it as ""display quality"" and ""display operation_performance,"" the latter was more consistently supported across the agents. The majority sentiment intensity was -4.

2. **Laptop (Group 2):** The aspect term ""laptop"" and the sentiments ""very frustrating"" and ""defective"" appeared consistently. The sentiment intensity varied slightly, but -4 is a moderate choice reflecting the assessments.

3. **Touch Pad (Group 3):** The majority identified the issue with the touchpad, categorizing it under ""keyboard operation_performance"" due to its usage context, which is commonly related to input devices. The sentiment intensity score of -3 is a balanced consensus.

4. **Wifi (Group 4):** Agents noted the difficulty with wifi connectivity, and ""laptop connectivity"" is the appropriate category. A sentiment intensity score of -3 averages the slight variances presented by agents.

5. **Asus (Group 5):** The brand ""Asus"" consistently faced negative assessments for perceived declining company quality. Sentiment intensities ranged slightly, but -4 is consistent with the majority of opinions expressed.

This final result integrates the majority perspective from the three agents, focusing on coherently presenting the analysis that reflects the intersecting findings."

**Conclusion:**
- There is consensus across the LLM agents regarding an intense negative sentiment associated with the ""laptop"" due to its quality, specifically cracking shortly after purchase.
- The sentiment around ""laptop durability"" (or general quality/performance) is slightly positive, reflecting appreciation for its past performance.
- The desire for a refund and the decision not to repurchase point to a strong negative sentiment towards the company's general experience. The intensity for the refund aspect ranges from moderate to very strong negative.
- Consolidating this, the major issues revolve around physical quality (cracking) and customer satisfaction (refund, repurchasing)."

I called apple support but they wore useless. I got everything they told me to, I did everything they told me to and there is still no way for the the computers to find eachother....
I called the apple store but I will have to leave both laptops for days in order for them to do it and I can not afford being away from my laptop due to work.

525,"When I initially bought this and started using it I thought it was the best thing since sliced bread. But then it got progressively worse from there. I will do cons and then pros if that's ok?

Cons:
Polaris Office - Failed on me several times, why include it if it doesn't work? There is no support for this application either.
Apps - There is no Android support mechanism that I can see. What do you do if there something wrong? Think about this. If you buy something in a store you can return it. Can you return an App???
Skype - Fails to work. Causes issues with Skype on my other devices.
Speakers - Very poor sound from the speakers. My phone has better sound. You will need earphones unless you are in a cave.
Marketplace - You can ONLY buy videos from Google. Therefore you can only buy from their collection which has no TV episodes. Surely there is a Competition and Monopolies Commission that can do something about this? Didn't they do this and sue Microsoft back in the day?
Videos - I bought two videos to watch on a plane. I started watching one and then decided I would watch the rest later. It will not play for me no matter what. So, I decided I would try the second video. Just to be cruel to myself I paused and went out of the Video app to look at another app and when I came back this second video would not play either. Gave an error eventually.
Keyboard* - The keyboard, sold seperately, has to be the worst designed piece of hardware I have ever come across. The spacebar is too close to the mousepad which is far too sensitive. If you are typing and the heel of your hand brushes off it expect to see your text somewhere else on the page.

Pros:
Design - Physically this is lightweight and slick. The concept of allowing a keyboard attachment is great but in practice fails.
Battery - Seems to be really good.
Software - Android is ok. Unfortunately they seem to accept mediocrity. In the long run I can see them failing as either Apple, Microsoft or some unknown will blitz them if they allow higher sales at the expense of mediocrity.
Browser - Pretty good. Some sites don't translate well. Anything that needs an internal move of the mouse such as a cursor bar will not work well or at all. Would be nice if the browser ranked bookmarks in order of most use.
Supernote - This is really good. I used it a conference to takes notes instead of using a pen and paper.

Overall I made the mistake of not understanding exactly what I would use it for and then testing each application. But who has time to do that?","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

### Explanation:

1. **Aspect Term and Category:** 
   - For ""Acer,"" ""user friendliness,"" ""portability,"" and ""color screen,"" the consensus among the agents was maintained, assigning ""company general,"" ""laptop usability,"" ""laptop portability,"" and ""display quality"" respectively.
   - ""Storage"" was consistently categorized under ""hard_disc usability.""

2. **Opinion Term:** 
   - The opinion terms were consolidated based on the cumulative input, with some minor refinements to ensure the original expression's intent was preserved.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:** 
   - For ""Acer,"" a positive sentiment was consistently observed with a score settled at 4 as two agents suggested a score of 4.
   - For ""storage,"" the score was agreed upon at 3, aligning with the majority.
   - ""User friendliness"" and ""portability"" were labeled with a positive sentiment and a score of 2 based on agent consensus.
   - For the ""color screen,"" a consistently strong positive sentiment (score of 5) was recorded.

The final output reflects a thorough reconciliation of the inputs from all three agents, presenting a balanced and representative perspective."

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**

1. **Aspect Term - Cable:**
   - The consensus from the agents identifies ""cable"" as an aspect with a negative sentiment due to the observation that it ""always warps."" Agent 2 categorized it under ""laptop quality,"" which seems appropriate since the cable's build quality affects this aspect. Thus, ""cable"" is consolidated under the category ""laptop quality"" with a negative sentiment and an average intensity score of -3, considering the agent input variance.

2. **Aspect Term - Laptop:**
   - All agents agreed on the aspect ""laptop"" with a sentiment polarity that is negative. The phrase ""piece of s***"" strongly indicates poor quality, aligning it with the category ""laptop quality"" with a sentiment intensity score of -5.
   - However, ""shoulda known better and babied it all"" was interpreted differently, with some agents attributing a negative connotation while one found it neutral as it focuses on care rather than the laptop's quality itself. Given that neutrality leans more towards contextual instead of evaluative, we set it to ""laptop general"" with a neutral sentiment proportionality (intensity score of 0), acknowledging the difference in opinion.
  
Collectively, this provides a comprehensive and reconciled ABSA output from the competing analyses."

554,"We live in a basement apartment, and the internet comes in from one end of the house. My office is on the other end, and I was really struggling keeping a solid signal to my wireless router. I got this repeater to try to extend that range, while still maintaining as much of my internet speeds as possible. Here are my results:

***All speeds were clocked using SpeetTest.net on the same computer***
Speed I pay for: 50 Mbps

-WITHOUT THE REPEATER-
Speed in room of router: 60 Mbps down / 12 Mbps up
Speed in office (across house): 22 Mbps / 11 Mbps up

-WITH THE REPEATER HALFWAY BETWEEN ROUTER & OFFICE-
Speed in office (across house): 3 Mbps down / 5 Mbps up

-WITH THE REPEATER IN THE SAME ROOM AS ROUTER-
Speed in room of router/repeater: 22 Mbps down / 12 Mbps up

Overall, the repeater did help extend my network, but it reduced my download & upload speeds drastically. So if you are okay with reduced download speeds or you are looking for something to extend your upload range, this might be a good choice for you. For me, I was hoping to get the full 50 Mbps in my office since the unit claims to be able to transfer 300 Mbps, but that just did not hold true.

One last note: The repeater does look like it covers both outlets, but if you use it on the upper outlet the lower outlet is still accessible for a normal-sized plug (a wall-wart would not fit)","```json

556,"I'm typing on my PROfolio+, which is a present to myself, even as I write this review.  I'm a touch typist and this is soooo much easier and faster than using the iPad's keyboard on the screen.  Plus, I have more screen space, since the keyboard no longer pops up, whenever I type.  I've been using it for over six weeks, for at least a few minutes every evening (sometimes much longer) and have yet to have to recharge the keyboard.  It's nice to have the backlighting, in case I want to type in dim light or even in the dark.  Even though the keyboard can only be propped up at one angle, I haven't found that to be a problem. This is not the thinnest keyboard, but I like that it has the same feel and feedback as my laptop's full size keyboard, even though it doesn't have a built-in 10-key pad. The keys are nicely spaced apart and I was typing fast in no time. I would've liked it if I could turn the iPad vertically (into portrait mode) for apps that on work in portrait mode, but that hasn't been a very big problem, because the apps I use and type in, they auto rotate to landscape mode. I also like that that iPad automatically goes to sleep and wakes up, whenever I open or close it.","```json

### Consolidation Explanation

1. **Aspect Term:**
   - ""speakers"" is consistently identified as an aspect across all agents.
   - Money-related sentiment is common across ""don't waste your money"" leading to the consolidation under ""money.""

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - ""speakers"" are consistently categorized under ""multimedia_devices quality"" based on the emphasis on quality degrading (e.g., crackling, durability issues).
   - For the financial aspect, although there are different opinions, ""laptop price"" seems most fitting given the context and two agents associating the sentiment with pricing.

3. **Opinion Term:**
   - Collated from overlapping terms across agents: ""crackle and blow"", ""not last long"" for the speakers.
   - Unified the opinion term about money to ""don't waste your money.."" as it directly expresses the negativity toward spending.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:**
   - ""Speakers"": Consolidated as negative as unanimously agreed, and -4 intensity reflects severe degradation (aligned with majority).
   - ""Money"": Negative is consistent, with -5 reflecting a particularly strong caution against purchase, which two agents suggest.

Hence, the consolidated conclusion reconciles the varied interpretations by merging the clear consensus points."

560,"I had high hopes, as my other adapters don't have the convenient 90 turn. This adapter two-pack was packaged nicely, and the plastic feels sturdy and durable.

 A typical female 3.5mm jack is up to 0.1mm oversized, to accommodate slight plug variations.

 These adapters waaay exceed the tolerance range, however, and in the wrong direction! Rather than perhaps being slightly undersized to always fit, they are instead oversizedby almost 0.15mm.

580,"I've updated my review after a few months of using it. I've completely run out of space on the hard drive, window 10's constant updates have eaten up soooo much space. The laptops become sluggish, and unusable and with no more space it won't be able to accommodate future updates and will not get security updates etc.

Spend a bit more and get more space.

Pros:

Prompt delivery
Easy setup
Great battery life
Windsows 10 is good
Compact charger
Laptop is very slim and neat

Cons:

Not enough hard drive space. With windows 10s constant updates the space will run out quickly and I can see this laptop becoming sluggish. I only have 3gb of free storage left for updates and installs. I should note you can use a micro SD card to store music, videos etc. But that won't help me for the windows update.","```json

The  graphics are awesome and it is fast running it said it came with windows 7 but i guess i got lucky to have windows 8 instead  and i am glad to have that.

583,"I had decided to use my smartphone's (Galaxy S) Google Maps as my primary navigation tool a few months ago and I went back to a standalone GPS unit after experiencing problems with the spotty AT&T network connectivity and a weak GPS receiver on the phone.

I'd been using an older Garmin 4.3 incher for several years and the 1450LMT is very similar to the older model. No complaints there -- the interface is simple (QWERTY keyboard is much better!), the touch sensitivity has increased, and the 5-inch form factor is large and readable. Why fix something if it ain't broke?

pros: lifetime maps update, traffic rerouting / guidance, qwerty keyboard input
cons: slooow update process, no error-correction/suggestion with names (compared to a smartphone)","[

**Explanation:**
1. **Aspect Term & Category:** For the aspect term 'laptop', the majority assigned it to ""laptop general"", which seems appropriate for the overall impressions. For 'price', the consensus is a direct connection to the 'laptop price' category. Agent 2 suggested 'company price', but given the context about buying the laptop, 'laptop price' is more fitting. For 'purchase', although Agent 2 classified it under 'company general', it aligns better under 'laptop general' due to the satisfaction expressed with the laptop's acquisition.
   
2. **Opinion Term:** The integrated approach draws from the consensus of LLM agents. 'Love' and 'Just like new!' were repeatedly identified opinions towards the 'laptop'. The term 'great price' specifically addressed 'price'. 'Very happy' was consistently linked to the purchase satisfaction.

3. **Sentiment Intensity and Polarity:** Each sentiment was categorized as positive, given the consistent expression of satisfaction. The intensity score of '5' is applied to the 'laptop' aspect reflecting unanimous strong affection. For 'price', both a strong sentiment and a direct reference to value justify a '5'. The intensity for 'purchase' aligns with moderate excitement, hence a score of '4'. 

The output integrates and reconciles the findings from the LLM agents, presenting a clear aspect-oriented sentiment analysis."

    }
]
```

**Explanation:**

Based on the analysis of the outputs from the three LLM agents, the consolidated findings are as follows:

1. **Aspect Term:** 
   - **Price** and **Wi-Fi** are consistent aspect terms identified across all agents.

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - For ""price"", the majority category assigned is ""laptop price"" (Agents 1 and 3). ""laptop price"" is chosen because two out of three agents agreed on it.
   - For ""Wi-Fi"", all agents categorized it under ""laptop connectivity"", which is a consensus category.

3. **Opinion Term:**
   - For ""price"", the consistent opinion across all agents was ""so happy"".
   - For ""Wi-Fi"", we consolidated opinions based on overlap:
     - From Agents 1 and 3: ""most important"" and ""NO wireless""
     - ""cant NOT believe"" was included from Agents 1 and 3.

4. **Sentiment Polarity:**
   - ""price"" is consistently positive across all agents.
   - ""Wi-Fi"" is consistently negative across all agents.

5. **Sentiment Intensity Score:**
   - ""price"" received a consistent score of 4 from all agents except Agent 2, showcasing a strong positive sentiment.
   - ""Wi-Fi"" received a consistent score of -5 across all agents, indicating a strong negative sentiment.

6. **Consideration of Additional Aspects:**
   - The sentiment ""Very disappointed."" was placed under ""laptop connectivity"" since it directly relates to the absence of Wi-Fi as per the context provided in Agent 3 and aligns with the severe sentiment intensity (-5) of that aspect.

This final output consolidates the information provided by all three agents to deliver a comprehensive ABSA result."

597,"These headphones are beautiful and they sound very nice. Not as nice as my Sony MDR-SA5000s, but very nice nonetheless.

These are portable headphones (they fold into a carrying case) so they are not going to sound as good as a pair of full size studio headphones with bigger drivers.

They have some nice features, three different cables, one plain and two with mic and headset controls, one universal and one apple.

The apple cable works perfectly with a macbook or an iphone.

The carrying case is nice too.

Now, the problem I have with them:

I have big ears and a slightly big head, and if I leave these headphones on for a couple of hours my ears start to hurt pretty badly. This is because the ear cups are small and the headband is very tight and made of a very unyielding material.

Maybe this was done to improve sound isolation, I don't know, but for me it totally sucks.

I only bought these because I needed an emergency pair of headphones for work and my sonys got sent out for out-of-warranty repair, and these are the best reviewed headphones I could find at a certain retailer that will go unnamed.

I am eagerly awaiting the return of my sonys as my primary headphones at work.

I will probably either keep these for portable use, like when going on a trip, or I will give them to someone as a gift, someone for whom they would be a better fit.","```json

**Explanation:**
1. **Aspect Term & Sentences:**
   - The consistent aspect term ""laptop"" was identified by all agents, and it encompasses the positive sentiments expressed in sentences with ""most useful"" and ""love it!!!!!!"". All agents agreed that these sentiments are positive, and the consensus category is ""laptop usability.""
   
2. **Sentiment Intensity:**
   - For ""laptop usability,"" the predominant sentiment intensity score across agents ranges from 4-5, with 'love it!!!!!!' underpinning the higher, stronger positive sentiment, hence the final score of 5.

3. **Aspect Term ""laptop"" (Group 2):** 
   - Agents identified a distinct sentiment focused on being ""very impressed,"" classified under ""laptop quality."" This separate classification aligns with the strength of the sentiment described broadly as related to both usability and quality but segregated for precise ABSA extraction.

4. **Neutral Opinion Term:**
   - The phrase ""don't be surprised"" was recognized as neutral, and since 'buys one' was not a credible aspect term, it was refined to 'company'. This aligns with Agent 2’s sense of neutrality under 'company general.'

By incorporating common and distinct findings from the inputs, these consolidated insights accurately represent the document's holistic sentiment and aspect analysis."

**Explanation of Consolidation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category (Sound):**
   - The aspect term ""sound"" appeared consistently across all agents. Two agents (Agent 1 and Agent 3) categorized it under ""out_of_scope general"" and ""multimedia_devices operation_performance,"" with consensus leaning towards ""multimedia_devices operation_performance"" based on two of the three agents indicating this category.
   - Opinion terms included ""great"" consistently across reports.

2. **Aspect Term and Category (Battery):**
   - All agents identified ""battery"" with a negative sentiment due to its performance issues. The consistent category across analyses was ""battery operation_performance.""
   - Opinion terms included phrases describing dissatisfaction with battery life. Sentiment intensity scores varied. A median score of -3 provides a balanced reflection of the intensity.

3. **Aspect Term and Category (Price):**
   - The ""price"" aspect was identified only by Agent 2 with a positive sentiment and categorized under ""hardware price."" This identification reflects the explicit positive sentiment toward the price in the first and third lists. The sentiment intensity remained at 3.

These decisions witness a collaborative agreement on aspect terms and use varying intensity scores to balance the feedback provided by each agent, yielding a final consensus on the sentiment expressed in the text about each aspect."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term & Category Reconciliation:** 
   - For ""unit"" as the aspect term, there was a divergence between ""laptop quality"" and ""laptop general."" Given the frequent interpretation leaning towards a broader positive evaluation of the product, ""laptop general"" was selected as the final category.
   - For the aspect term involving ""power and speed,"" there was a categorization split between ""hardware operation_performance"" and ""cpu operation_performance."" Given the context and the focus on overall performance, ""hardware operation_performance"" suffices to encompass the components as a whole in the scenario provided.
   - In terms of ""recommend,"" the aspect seemed to fluctuate between ""out_of_scope general,"" ""company general,"" and ""company quality."" The tone of the recommendation aligns well with the ""company general"" category due to its overarching endorsement of the product and its provider.

2. **Opinion Term Consistency:** 
   - The opinion terms ""great!!!"" and ""definitely recommend"" were harmonized across all feedback with specific intensity, maintaining clarity and assertiveness.
   - Consistent articulation was favored with the phrase ""Great power"" and ""speed"" in scrutinizing the product’s performance strengths.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Alignment:** 
   - The sentiment polarity was consistently positive across aspects with intensity typically between strong (5) and robustly favorable (4), echoing a uniformly positive user experience facilitated by the product's design and performance attributes."

  Electrical....each camera requires an outlet,,also the monitor..Using the RCA cable(supplied),the can be plugged into a TV...
Easy to set up and operate...move the monitor around the house,,,no problem,with range of reception...
  One drawback on the system..the camera sits on its stem,,,and is difficult to obtain a secure mount,I torque the pressure screw down for a snug fit,,but does not feel like very secure...,you may want an ""angle down"",, application,,and a split is there to rotate the camera to an acute angle,,( hard to describe)..
  This would be an excellent indoor system...electrical outlets being right there....
mounted on the outside,,the bad guy could unplug the camera....
  Record...350 minuets on the provided card/chip,,,it records over itself...works well...
Packaging...I expected better on electronic  equipment...it was the system itself ,,from Defender,,in its box..the electronics here were suspended in its plastic wrap and did not appear to be protected from shock....this was in a larger box,,with some paper,,,

611,I bought this because I didn't have enough for the Surface Pro.  I was a little worried because of the processor but when I received this I was immediately able to upgrade to Windows 8 Pro and it was very very easy.  I was a little nervous when the update took so long but then I remember it had to download it and install it (took about 1-1.5hrs) but it is perfect!!!  any and everything I would do on my desktop and or laptop I have been able to do on this and even more.  It is extremely fast in booting and I love that.  Even my 6yr has found this very easy to use.  The only down side is that this particular one does not come with the keyboard case.  but you can purchase it from Acer directly for about $80.  If you have any questions feel free to email me ( I am an IT administrator)  Nicholas.stewart84@rocketmail.com,"```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Projector Aspect**: Dominantly agreed by the agents on very strong positive sentiment, with operations being smooth and positive feeling about the performance.

2. **Picture Aspect**: Consensus among agents on positive sentiment, highlighting the clarity of the display. Category is aligned with ""display quality.""

3. **Volume Aspect**: Here, there was a discrepancy in the sentiment polarity and score, but considering that two agents found it positive, the final output aligns with a slightly positive sentiment.

4. **Applications Aspect**: All agree on positive sentiment and good performance, thus it's classified as strong positive with operational efficiency.

5. **Remote Condition**: Negative sentiment was prevalent throughout all agents with varied aspect categories. Given the malfunction aspect, “multimedia_devices quality” is a suitable category with negative sentiment.

6. **Buttons Aspect**: Consistently neutral sentiment across the board, with usability tagged correctly under ""hardware usability.""

7. **Remote Acquisition**: Although opinions varied between neutral and negative, sentiment intensity and category align better under ""multimedia_devices usability"" with a neutral stance considering it's a question about process, not necessarily dissatisfaction."

### Explanation:
1. **Group 1:** All three agents agree that the laptop is positively viewed for its initial performance. There is agreement on the terms ""very well"" and ""solid"" as opinions, and the category identified is consistently ""laptop general"". The average intensity score from the agents is approximately 3.33.
   
2. **Group 2:** Two agents (1 & 3) align on the ""wifi"" aspect term and categorize it under ""laptop connectivity"". The sentiment is negative with varying intensity scores, where we lean towards agent 2's stronger intensity for consistent negative tone across related descriptions, setting it to -4.

3. **Group 3:** All agents identify this as a neutral action of attaching an ethernet cord, with agent 1 considering it negative while others treat it as neutral towards either ""laptop operation_performance"" or ""ports connectivity"". We finalize it as neutral, under ""ports connectivity"".

4. **Group 4:** The dominant consensus from agents 2 & 3 on the ""driver issues"" as an aspect term fits into the ""software operation_performance"" category with a strong negative sentiment (-5), supported by all agents."

**Rationale:**
1. **Operation Performance Aspect**: All agents recognize a major negative sentiment towards the computer's operation performance, specifically its speed. The sentiment intensity is consistently identified as very strong negative (-5), particularly related to the terms “SOOOOOOOO SLOOOOW” and “not very impressive.”

2. **General Aspect**: For the advice to ""look around past this one,” there is consensus about a negative sentiment towards the computer, leading to a consolidated decision on this being classified under a general category of laptops with a moderate negative intensity (-2).

3. **Usability**: The sentence related to everyday use points to a neutral evaluation regarding its usability for regular tasks, a conclusion reached by two agents. Therefore, this aspect remains neutral with a sentiment intensity of 0."

    }
]
```

**Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term and Sentiment Analysis:**

   - **Laptop:**
     - All agents agree that ""laptop"" is referred to positively with intense expressions such as ""Best"" and ""ever owned!!!!"". This was classified under ""laptop general"" with a maximum intensity score of 5.

   - **Screen Resolution:**
     - The opinions on the category for ""screen resolution"" varied slightly. Agent 1 classified it as ""display quality"", Agent 2 as ""display design_features"", and Agent 3 as ""display operation_performance"". Given the term ""awesome"" pertains to quality, ""display quality"" is the most suitable category, and an average intensity score of 4.5 (from 4 and 5) is used.

   - **Recommendation:**
     - Agents 2 and 3 extracted ""recommend"" with a positive sentiment towards the laptop or general company sentiment. Given the context of recommending the laptop, it fits under ""laptop general"" with a score of 2, which aligns with moderate encouragement.

Overall, this reflects a coherent synthesis of agent findings, focusing on category consensus and sentiment strength."

**Explanation:**
- The analysis for aspect terms, opinion terms, sentiment polarity, and intensity score were integrated from the three agents' outputs based on consensus and average intensities when scores differed slightly.
- Consensus was reached on the reported categories for each aspect.
- Clarification of some aspect terms was done for coherence and understanding, e.g., ""overall satisfaction"" for the sentiment expressed toward the purchase experience."

**Final Conclusion:**

1. **Aspect Term Identification**: 
   - Agents identified ""reviews,"" ""battery,"" ""return,"" and related terms like ""product"" and ""return process"" as explicit aspects.

2. **Aspect Categorization**: 
   - ""Reviews"" fit best under ""out_of_scope general"" because it's more about regret over ignoring reviews.
   - ""Battery"" is consistently categorized as ""battery operation_performance.""
   - ""Product"" was mapped to ""company quality"" because of overall product dissatisfaction, aligning with the term ""absolute garbage.""
   - Differences on ""return"" focus were reconciled, categorizing it under both ""shipping operation_performance"" and ""company quality"" based on context.

3. **Opinion Term Extraction**: 
   - Opinion terms about battery operation were straightforward: ""lasts about 10 minutes,"" ""does not re-charge.""
   - ""Absolute garbage"" and ""DO NOT BUY"" were consistently noted as strong negative sentiments about the overall product.
   - ""Too late to return"" was cited as a negative sentiment about the return process.

4. **Sentiment Polarity**: 
   - All identified aspects were consistently negative across agents.

5. **Sentiment Intensity Score**: 
   - Scores aligned across most aspects, assigning high negative intensity (-5) to product quality complaints due to overall strong dissatisfaction expressed. 
   - Battery issues were consistently marked as -3 due to moderate dissatisfaction with performance, while returns got a moderate score of -2 reflecting late-process frustration."

I used to have a HP Pavilion a1010n it had 512mb RAM, 3ghz processor, and like 32mb Video card and when i upgraded i was AMAZED at the difference of speed and graphics as far as games are concerned. My friend thinks that i got ripped off i was like no way. He asked me what the processor speed was and he was like no theres no way your probably thinking of like 2.3ghz. Seriously get this computer it is a BEAST.

630,Ok so I have a 64bit Windows 7 HP laptop with a built in Atheros wifi adapter and never really had any problems with it until I rented a room out from some people who live in a 2 story house and the wireless modem upstairs. I previously gave this adapter a bad review but it was a mistake. I do not know what happened and maybe it just needed to be broken in but this adapter all of a sudden started working waaaayyyy better. It now picks up many connections that my other adapter cannot see and the reception is much better. I was ready to RMA this thing but for the passed couple of days it changed. Maybe it is psychic and knew I was gonna return it so it had a change of heart? lol jk but this product is amazing and has saved me a lot of trouble. So if you are someone with a similar OS as mine and a similar situation where the modem is a floor up and out then this will solve your problems but you may have to break it in I guess. I had originally gave it 2 stars because when I first plugged it in it was only picking up 2 networks whereas my other card was picking up 5 almost 6 and my connection problems were still bad but just before I was about to return it I turned on my computer and it is now picking up 10 to 12 networks and the reception has shot up and I didn't update the driver it is the one that comes on the disc so you might have to give it some time to work  I guess?,"```json

631,"Save your money. It uses a 1990's based Celeron processor, which even Wikipedia says has noticeably e degraded performance compared to any modern CPU.

It's slow and easily overwhelmed, can't handle a High Definition YouTube and MS Word without being annoyingly sluggish. I'm only on here writing this because my work laptop (a Dell Latitude E7240)  is sooooooo much better, so much so that I've begun to bring it home every night.  In fact I'm only writing this review because looking for a personal Dell to own has rekindled my hatred for my Lenovo.

Seriously people, spending $150 more will give you at least a five fold performance boost. Don't be so cheap. I learned that the hard way.

636,"I got this to replace an earlier model of the same camera. The battery/card compartment wants to unlatch, be aware that when you do open it the battery latch is probably going to open as well and dump your battery on the floor. The spring mechanism for the card is also shall we say bouncy-the first time I ejected my card it popped up and out about 3 feet like toast in a cartoon!!!
Having more megapixels doesn't necessarily mean having a better picture-the old model took much better macro and video. Will not buy this brand again-back to Fuji for me.","```json

PROS:
Its beautiful, its fast, it handles sony vegas pro, illustrator, photoshop, and all those design/video softwares great. I am not a gamer, but I do edit videos and do design and this is why I got it.

CONS:
the mouse pad, im not a big fan, un cant have your fingers on it and press click (without clicking on the actual click button, just pressing in the middle of the pad) at the same time, you either lift alll ur fingers and press in the middle, or use the click button, whihc I guess I will get use to but right now its a bit annoying.
And of course the much said fingerprint magnet, its amazing how it gets marked. I love the look, but I've given up on cleaning it all the time already, but well... other than that its looks slick.","```json

647,"Just now getting around to reviewing this item - I like it just fine. My macbook has been wearing it continuously for almost 5 years now and i've had no complaints whatsoever. One of the little back feet broke off a few weeks ago so I've been considering buying another and maybe going for a different color. But then i never really used the feet much. AS FAR AS laptops go, this one gets pretty hot underneath so it gets uncomfortable using it actually on my lap. Only I found a hot pink plastic cutting board at the grocery store the exact right size for this to sit on and that helps a lot. Now if I were to get another color cover i might have to get a new cutting board to match. Hmmm ... it's only missing one foot - maybe if i could replace only the bottom part?","```json

648,"I gave this product 3 star based on the Pros & Cons as stated below:

Pros:
- Downloadable software from intel website to schedule trimming for SSD optimizing.
- Downloadable software from intel website for cloning purpose.
- Comes with a Sata III cable.
- Comes with 5 screws that could be used in securing the SSD to HDD Bay in Desktop.

Cons:
- Software does not have a benchmark to tell how much read and write your system perform.
- (major) Does not detect as a SSD in older laptop (tested with Samsung Evo Pro which could reflect in the BIOS of older laptop).

Overall:
I bought it with the intention of reviving my older laptop which is around 5-6 years old but to my dismay, it could not detect in the BIOS of the system. So i tested my laptop with a Samsung Evo Pro which return a positive test result instead.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term:** ""cover keyboard"", ""keyboard"", and ""company"" were consistently recognized across agents. For simplicity and accuracy, I consolidated some aspects like ""handled the issue"" and ""company service"" under ""company service"" as it captures the broader scope of company's action and support.

2. **Aspect Category:** There was general consensus on the ""keyboard design_features"" category for ""cover keyboard"". For the ""keyboard"" aspect, the consensus was more towards ""keyboard operation_performance."" The ""company"" related comments are best categorized under ""company support"", which aligns well with the sentiment of effective issue resolution.

3. **Opinion Term:** ""Loved"" and ""stopped working"" were retained from agent outputs, as they were consistently identified by each agent. ""Handled ... perfectly"" captures the essence of the sentiment towards the company's action.

4. **Sentiment Polarity:** The sentiment polarity was consistently positive for the design features and company categories, and negative for the keyboard's operation performance after a few months.

5. **Sentiment Intensity Score:** I opted for a strong positive intensity score (4) for ""loved the cover keyboard"" and for the company's action, to reflect the strong sentiment expressed in the text. A strong negative score (-4) was applied for the keyboard operation issue, aligning with the gravity of a complete failure noted by both agents 1 and 2."

**Explanation:**

1. **Battery Life:**
   - All three agents correctly identified ""battery life"" in the context of preserving it as a positive aspect.
   - There was consensus on the category being ""battery operation_performance"" with a consistent sentiment intensity score of ""2"".

2. **General Offering:**
   - Across agents, phrases like ""Love It!!!"" and ""Awesome"" were associated with ""It"" or a general positive sentiment about the offering.
   - Combined two aspects from Agent 2 (""It"") and Agent 3 (""general offering"") due to overlapping opinion terms, settling on ""laptop general"" as a common ground.
   - Maintained a strong sentiment intensity score consistent with the highly positive expressions from agents.

3. **Performance:**
   - The phrase ""Works great"" was consistently recognized, though the aspect term varied (""functionality"", ""Works"", and ""performance"").
   - Chose ""performance"" because it closely aligns with the overall sentiment about the product, which captures operation-related performance.
   - Decided on ""laptop operation_performance"" as this was the consensus in terms of its general applicability."
662,"Pros:
Fast start-up
Light weight
Great internal specs with 6GB RAM and 1TB HD
Computer doesn't overheat even if external vents are blocked
DVD/CD-ROM drive (writable)
Has webcam (low res)

Cons:
The track pad moves on its own and is a little twitchy and non-responsive at times. Terrible webcam resolution. The video resolution is so bad that you can't even have a clear Skype chat without looking blurry. The computer has a plastic body and doesn't feel sturdy at all. Oh and one last time....non-user friendly windows 8...3 letters. O-M-G.

This PC is a 64 bit system (not a 32 bit as some others have mentioned) It can be converted from Windows 8 to Windows 7 with a installation CD. And yes, it must be genuine Microsoft or it won't work.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Sound Quality:**
   - Identified the aspect term as ""sound quality"".
   - Agreed upon the category ""multimedia_devices quality"".
   - Consensus on the positive sentiment with intensity score mostly between 3 to 4. Finalized as 4 due to majority lean and agent 1's explicit emphasis on stronger sentiment description.

2. **Size/Portability:**
   - For ""size"", which often describes portability, all agents recognized similar sentiments. The key opinions ""more compact"", ""easier to fit"", ""comfortable"", and ""does the trick"" were consistent between agents.
   - The overall sentiment fitting ""laptop portability"" with a moderate positive score of 2, as reflected by both agents 1 and 3.

3. **Speaker:**
   - The term analysis varied slightly but was generally captured as part of evaluating sound performance. The most comprehensive term consensus was ""Sooo much more better"".
   - The sentiment category would be ""multimedia_devices operation_performance"" with a strong positive intensity of 4, shared between agents for this specific statement."

I had wanted to swap out my HDD for an SSD for quite some time, and honestly, I was blown away by the performance upgrade. Srsly...this was a HUMONGOUS improvement in speed and performance, couldn't be happier, and Amazon has a great price with Prime shipping.

I just Googled instructions on how to install the drive, and it was very simple. One think I would note, for those who are less experienced with computers, when you take out the old drive in your MacBook, make sure you unscrew the small metal screws in the drive, and screw them into the m4 SSD. That will secure the drive in your MacBook.

Highly recommended!!!","```json

670,"This is the 2nd Mac that I have had after my Powerbook G4.

I had the B model and got this one because of the Nvidia Card and I am soooo satisfied!

If one thing I have learned about these machines is that they hold up very well to wear and tear.

There isn't too much more that  I can say that everyone else has said already except that for what you spend you get top notch quality.

A lot of people are afraid to go Mac because they are so used to WIndows but take it from a long time Windows user, after a few montsh playing with these Macs, you will wonder what took you so long to come here!

Best of all you very rarely ever have to worry about any issues with these machines.  My wife has had a G5 for the past 4 years with no problems, while I have been through at least 3 Windows machines and AV programs so it was just inevitable that I would make the move. If you are that afraid of Mac, you can always get a Macbook and install boot camp whcih will allow you to use  Windows but best believe you may ditch it before long!

676,"I originally bought this for my theater room which has a projector, and 7.1 system.  I also have an ABUS system with keypads that allows music to be played in various rooms in my home.  I liked the idea of a networked receiver which could find and play my music stored on various computers hooked into the network.  As time has gone on, however, I have found this receiver (and those like it) to become more and more obsolete.  The Audyssey is a nice feature for setting up the theater room, but the receiver itself has proven completely useless for managing large music collections. Not only is it way too slow, but limited in it's ability to playback a number of lossless formats.  There are several remote apps available for droid and apple, but they are also cumbersome, and none can actually power on the unit.  I really like it for my theater room as it actually can be a modified 9.1.  I think the sound is terrific.  I have Polk LSI 9s and the LSI C for my Front 3 speakers and my surround speakers are 4 ohm in-ceiling as well, which sound great but tough to drive.  After my Aragon 8008BB, there is no going back to any one-unit-does-all a/v amp, although the Denon adequately drives the surround and center speaker.  All of the rest of my video (home movies, etc.) runs from the computer.

What I am doing now for my ABUS is using a computer as a server which I can access via smart phone or ipad using Plex which can stream both audio or video as well as online radio, including Spotify and Pandora. I don't use anything with RGB or RCA video anymore, and hooking up an ipod dock is way over as a technology.  In my mind, All-in-one receivers like this are on the way out as networked computers can provide most of it's functions.  It will be going up for sale.

As a young man, I started out trying to get the best amplifier with speakers I could afford.  It then expanded into DSP preamps, tuners, phonograph, tape players, CD and DVD players.  It is ironic to me that after the many years and 1000s of dollars I have spent on various equipment, that I am back where I started, which is putting my $ into the best amplifier and speakers I can afford with a computer to do the rest.","```json

681,"Sorry but I spent months debating about what headphone to buy. I was leery about spending this kind of money on headphones. I have to tell you after trying all the best and top brands: Sony, Beats by Dre, JVC, Seinheisser, etc. These destroy them. You can't tell from the photo but the frame is metal and it is covered by this slick black coating. Underneath the metal your head is supported by this ""memory foam feeling gell type"" layer which is soooooo comfortable. I love the braded cord that comes with it; slightly short but hell spend a few bucks to get an extension cable. The cord also has volume controls with a play button which works on my iPod 5th Gen.

Best feature is that the cord detaches from the head set which prevents accidental breakage and also allows you to upgrade further with higher quality 3.5mm cables. Lastly the case that comes with it along with the clip are awesome.","```json

```

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Keyboard Usability:** The sentiment ""not conducive to typing"" as identified by Agent 1 is valid, as all agents indirectly refer to the typing experience. Therefore, it remains as identified by Agent 1.

2. **Keyboard Operation_Performance:** Both Agents 1 and 2 identified issues with the keys ""depressed with force"" and ""will not print,"" which express negative sentiment about the keyboard's operation performance. The intensity score from Agent 1 is slightly stronger, reflecting the severity better than Agent 2, so a score of -4 was chosen.

3. **Out of Scope General:** The phrase ""DO NOT BUY!!!!!!"" from Agent 2 clearly shows an overall negative sentiment towards the product, which is out of scope of the predefined categories. This sentiment is strongly negative, aligning with Agent 2's intensity score of -5. Agent 3 included it as part of keyboard quality, but since it's a general recommendation, aligning with Agent 2's categorization seems more appropriate."

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1: Laptop Fit**
   - Both Agents 1 and 3 identified the aspect term ""laptop"" with a category of ""laptop design_features,"" and they provided a sentiment intensity of 5 with similar opinion terms, which were consolidated into a single opinion term ""perfectly!!"". Agent 2 also identified it as ""laptop"" but suggested ""laptop portability,"" the majority consensus and stronger case are for ""laptop design_features.""
   
2. **Group 2: Readability**
   - All agents identified similar sentiments toward ""readability."" Consolidating the interpretations, the aspect ""readability"" was agreed upon. For sentiment intensity, rounding down the varied scores to the midpoint results in an intensity score of 2.
   
3. **Group 3: User Experience**
   - Agents 2 and 3 provided insights on the general enjoyment of experience, with a focus category on ""usability."" This was combined into ""laptop usability,"" given the context and specific mentions of user experience with sentiment strength at 5 across the board. ""User experience"" was used as a more descriptive term."

**Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term & Opinion Term**:
   - There is a clear consensus across agents that the discussion focuses on the ""item"" and the issue of it ""stopped working"" as well as ""same problem"". All agents consistently identify these terms.

2. **Category**:
   - Despite differing views on whether the issue revolves around a product category or operational performance (as per Agent 2's perspective), the primary aspect discussed is the quality of the item/products, checking across the three agents' understanding. Therefore, ""laptop quality"" is chosen as most appropriate.

3. **Sentiment Polarity & Intensity**:
   - All agents agree on a negative sentiment due to repeated failures, with intensity scores ranging from -3 to -5. Taking into account contextual emphasis and strong negative wording, a sentiment intensity of -5 (strong negative) was determined for the overall user experience (""item""). For recurrent issues (""problem""), a score of -4 was retained, reflecting severe dissatisfaction without the complete extremity of the main ""item"" issue.

These conclusions reconcile various interpretations, particularly between differing emphasis in categorization and sentiment strengths."

691,"UPDATED:

This unit fully supports 3 HDMI 1080P through with full 5.1 & 7.1 LPCM support. If your Blu-Ray (PS3) is set to output LPCM then DTS HD adn DOLBY HD output as LPCM and sound great Supports full 24 bit / 192 khz 7.1 and sounds really, really good.

I wish the digital was more easily re-assignable. For example, my Comcast box HDMI has to be accessed through the ""SAT"" button, and my computer audio is on the ""TV"" button. Programmable button commands (my old Panasonic had) would have made this perfect for the money.

A great buy!!!

I just ordered this from Sony (product available on 4/4/08, so I have three weeks or so until they ship.) I had a DG710 and although the description read that it accepted LPCM through HDMI the reality was it only accepted 2.1 LPCM through HDMI! You have to use Bitstream and DD or DTS for 5.1 or 6.1.

I was furious, I contacted Sony customer support and they didn't know the DG710 didn't play 5.1 LPCM! They told me it was defective. I returned it and the same problem occurred with the new one. So I am returning the new one and I ordered the new DG720. All the Sony STRDG models have been upgraded to from 510, 710, 810 and 910 to 520. 720, 820 and 920. The difference, now they all handle surround LCPM. The STRDG720 also has 1 more HDMI than the 710, and that's exactly what I need so I am very happy about that change.

If it doesn't work I will update this review around the middle of April.","```json

I ordered this one because the picture showed a different tip on the stylus than the one I am used to. The tip is actually the same as other styluses, BUT, this one is WAY more responsive, and for the size, it' very accurate and it requires very little pressure.

I have big hands so, the size is actually comfortable for me but not as practical as it could be but that's a minor gripe. For this price and all the benefits, this is the one to get, hands down!!!","```json

**Integration and Reconciliation Explanation:**

1. **MSI Warranty:**
   - All agents agree on the positive sentiment regarding the aspect.
   - The intensity score provided by all agents is consistent at 2, indicating slight to moderate positive sentiment.
   - The aspect term is best represented as ""MSI warranty,"" based on a more precise naming from Agent 1.

2. **RAM Upgrade:**
   - There is some disagreement in sentiment (mixed by Agent 1, negative by Agent 3, positive by Agent 2). 
   - For practical decision making, the angle of ""easiest and cheapest way to boost performance"" seems most emphasized positively by Agents 1 and 2. 
   - Therefore, I consolidated it as positive with a higher score (3) under ""memory operation_performance"" as Agent 2's input was aligned with operational implications.

3. **Processing Speed:**
   - Negative sentiment consensus on slow processing speed shared by Agents 2 and 3 with consistent intensity scores.
   - Assigned the aspect to ""cpu operation_performance"" which aligns with the slow processing speed aspect rather than the RAM upgrade.

4. **Netbooks Rating:**
   - All agents report positive sentiment for the netbooks reflected in the five-star rating.
   - Intensity score decision inclined towards 4 reflecting an overall positive impression on laptop classification and market perception despite not having purchased yet.

The above decisions account for balancing divergent assessments while incorporating agreement points where consensus occurs among the agents."

707,"Update: adapter quick working suddenly and would not power on at all.  However the seller has it setup super easy to get a refund .

My laptop would only pick up 2.4 Ghz signal  but I needed an option to get a 5Ghz signal since that signal was so much faster on speedtest. The setup was pretty much painless. On my laptop when I selected the wifi networks I noticed that the device creates a 'WiFi 2' category that has all the same networks that the 'WiFi' category had. I turned off the original laptop's wifi and made sure the wifi 2 category was selected. This will enable you to access the wifi signals through this device. Like magic it allowed me to connect to the my Router's 5Ghz signal and now my internet is much faster. Great product!!!","```json

708,"I enjoy this tablet, but I think it has some major flaws. I'll start with what I like. It has a good size, and I really like the free office for a year. It runs little games pretty well, and the keyboard is nice. It takes some getting used to since it's small, but it works good. However, my trackpad was placed on the tablet skewed so it doesn't work. The cover thing for the trackpad doesn't lay flat and therefore has never worked. I went out and bought a wireless mouse for it so I'm not too upset about it. It sure was annoying it figure that out though, so be warned that your trackpad might be defective. Also, my right speaker on the bad doesn't work. So..... that's fun. And I already have notes on here for one of my classes I'm taking right now so I can't return it until that class is done. I'm disappointed that so many defects are apparent in my purchase. I think I would be a different one if I could go back in time, but it does what I bought it to do. Which is take notes in class. I just wanted to stream music from it while I study :(","```json

713,"I bought this camera to watch my screen porch during the day after a couple of incidents of trespassing.  It works OK in the day.  The integrated web server and motion sensing is a necessary feature since if you don't want to have to have a computer running all day to monitor the video for motion.

The wireless network card isn't great- I get like 40% connectivity to my router that's about 30 feet and 2 rooms away.  However, most wireless cameras don't offer WPA2 encryption and I'd never go back to the incredibly insecure WEP just to run a wireless camera.  That said, I bought a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/D-Link-DWL-P50-Power-over-Ethernet-PoE-Adapter/dp/B0006GDC2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">D-Link DWL-P50 Power over Ethernet (PoE) Adapter</a>&nbsp;so that I can run power-over-Ethernet to the camera because I think the wireless is a little sketchy and it's easy to saturate the limited bandwidth that the card can handle.  I haven't yet had the courage to cut and splice the camera power adapter to use it with PoE.  Obviously, the PoE power cord doesn't fit in the camera receptacle, which is a shame.

The email feature works about 70% of the time, the ftp feature works more often.  I don't see how to enable the NTP feature so I have to manually set the time every time the camera is unplugged. Two of the best features are the ability to turn off the blue LED and the stand.  The stand is highly configurable.  However, the lens is useless at night.  I installed a 200W halogen motion light about the porch door and the camera captures a images when the light comes on, but they're so poor as to be useless.

All in all, a decent camera on the cheap.  It's no Axis, but it's reasonably priced.","```json

714,"The Magnasonic iPhone/iPod clock radio is a basic little box that does what it says it will do. It will play FM stations and allows for 20 pre-programmed ones. It will play and sync your iPod and allows you to navigate among your songs by next and previous buttons. It offers two alarms and a snooze. The sound is okay--neither very good nor very bad. The machine is not beautiful, but it's also not ugly. The button functionality is not immediately intuitive, but you can eventually make sense of it. (I noticed at least a couple errors in the directions, which makes things that much harder.) There's no way I would rely on it as my main alarm clock because of how difficult it would be to operate the machine when not mentally acute. (The BEST, most intuitive alarm clock I have ever owned--and I've owned a number--is this one:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sony-ICFC180-AM-FM-Clock-Radio/dp/B000EDTS6A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sony ICFC180 AM/FM Clock Radio</a>.) But it would be okay to have this one by your desk or in your kitchen to use as a source of music and, very occasionally, as an alarm.

I plugged my iPod Touch 2g into the machine at first and was met by the disheartening message that the device was not supported by the iPod, but that turned out not to be true: a nudge or two and it worked okay. With my&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Incipio-case/dp/B001FB6S0E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Incipio case</a>&nbsp;on, however, the connection between the iPod Touch and the clock radio was not very secure. It didn't take much for the connection to break, though if I fiddled with it I could get it to work. Without the case the connection was better. Best yet, however, was when I plugged in my daughter's iPod Nano 3g, which fit very snugly. She consequently inherits the clock radio.

In short, it's a serviceable device that may suit your needs, depending on what your needs are.

### Explanation:
1. **Group 1: Touchscreen Operation**
   - The consensus across agents identifies a problematic aspect with the touchscreen. Two agents categorize the sentiment as negative, particularly focusing on the “starts playing” issue. The intensity score of -3 reflects a unified view aligning closer with the negative sentiment due to the frustration noted in ""starts playing the 'press dot' game.""

2. **Group 2: Touchscreen Usability**
   - All agents agree on the touchscreen's repeated calibration issue, which is clearly a negative usability problem. The sentiment intensity varied, but averaging insights gives us an intensified negative score of -4, reflecting the significant frustration with its usability described consistently across analyses.

3. **Group 3: OS Operation Performance (Master Reset)**
   - Agreement is absolute on this aspect. The inability of the master reset to resolve the issue is negatively perceived in all analyses, and the consensus on sentiment intensity is -2.

4. **Group 4: Return Process**
   - Across all agents, there is a neutral sentiment linked to the return process, described without strong positive or negative language. The category was slightly disputed (support vs. shipping), but shipping operation_performance reflects the process described in the return and refund context. The neutrality and intensity score of 0 are consistent."

This consolidated output integrates and reconciles the different analyses provided by the LLM agents, focusing on identifying the most consistent and agreed-upon aspects, opinions, sentiments, and categories across the three agents. Aspects with strong consensus in opinion and sentiment have been prioritized, and aspects with differing sentiment or category interpretations have been carefully evaluated to represent the most fitting analysis."

**Explanation of Reconciliation:**

1. **Aspect Term:** 
   - The phrase ""practical and cheap"" was consolidated to focus on ""price"" as an aspect term. This aligns with the interpretation from Agent 2, which identifies ""price"" more explicitly and is consistent with the sentiment.
   - ""plastic smell"" and ""plastic material"" both focus on issues related to the quality of the laptop, particularly the undesirable smell and potential concerns over the material, as highlighted by all three agents.

2. **Aspect Category:** 
   - All agents identified the price factor under the category ""laptop price.""
   - While the ""plastic smell"" and ""plastic material"" issues span ""hardware quality"" and ""laptop quality"" categories, the primary concern is about the quality aspect of the laptop's construction, specifically its odor and potential material risk, thus falling under ""laptop quality"" as a general consensus.

3. **Opinion Term:**
   - The opinion terms were extracted based on the collective input of all agents, focusing on relevant expressions.
   - For ""price,"" opinions like ""Practical"" and ""cheap"" provide a clear positive sentiment.
   - For the negative sentiment regarding the plastic, phrases directly conveying the repulsive odor and quality concerns, such as ""smells so bad"" and ""hope it is not cancerous,"" were chosen.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:**
   - Sentiment polarity for price is consistently positive across all agents with an intensity score of 2, indicating slight/moderate positivity.
   - In terms of the plastic-related aspects, the overwhelming sentiment is negative, which is consistent across all agents. Agent 1 sets a strong negative intensity score of -5 due to the intense dislike of the smell and potential health concerns, which is agreed upon as representative. For the material concern, an intensity score of -4 is appropriate as emphasized by Agent 3."

**Explanation:**

1. **Dell 6430u:** All agents agree on the positive sentiment and intensity score of 4 for this aspect under ""laptop general.""

2. **Reliability:** The majority of the agents classified the opinion ""completely trouble free"" with a positive sentiment and a strong intensity score of 5 under ""laptop operation_performance.""

3. **Light:** Consolidating insights from Agent 1 and 2 for this aspect, this was recognized under ""laptop portability"" with a strong positive sentiment and matching intensity score of 5.

4. **Battery Life:** High consensus among agents classifies this with positive sentiment, with consensus on the aspect-category and sentiment intensity score of 5 under ""battery operation_performance.""

734,"I purposely choose not to spend $50+ on earbuds due to losing them or destroying them on a somewhat regular basis (same rule I apply to sunglasses).  I purchased to replace a lost set of older JVC (HAFX66A) earbuds that I absolutely loved.  My needs have changed a bit and I needed a pair that would put up with running as well as had a built-in MIC for phone calls.  My last two sets of earbuds (HA-FX66 & HA-FX34) have been JVC and I have been very pleased with them, so I figured I would give these a shot.

PROS
 - very clear sound quality
 - comfortable fit (may take some adjustment time)
 - stay in place
 - waterproof
 - MIC and Button work properly on iPhone6
 - MIC works properly on Windows laptop

CONS
 - limited bass
 - short cord is too short....with extension..too long

I cannot directly compare these HA-ETR40 to my older JVC since well...they are all lost.  However I can compare them to my much older ME-M6P earbuds which somehow I have not lost after 6 years.  I know for sure I preferred the sound quality of the older HA-FX66 over the ME-M6P.  But comparing the newer HA-ETR40 to the ME-M6P, I prefer the ME-M6P mostly due to the lack of bass from the HA-ETR40.  If the MIC was still functional on my ME-M6P, I would just use those.  Pretty sure years of these things (ME-M6P) being wadded up in my laptop bag has taken its toll.

Limited Bass -- This is very subjective to each user for sure.  My music tastes jump all over the place from Country, Rock, Alternative, Rap, Techno, and Classical depending on my mood and task at hand.  While sitting in my office which is quiet, placing the HA-ETR40 properly in my ears, fully sealed, the bass is there....until I swap in the ME-M6P and realize it really wasn't.  My ""assumption"" here is that my personal preference is for sure bass heavy and the ME-M6P is not balanced properly...but it is what I like.  What really kills it for me is that since the bass is somewhat weak, when I run I tend to leave the volume low and the earbuds are not fully seated so I can still hear noises around me.  This just makes the lack of bass that much more painful.","```json

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Group 1 (Charging):**
   - Agreement among agents that the charging performance of the battery is criticized severely (Aspect Term: ""charging"").
   - Consistent opinion terms (""very very slow"", ""soooo much time"", ""very less time"") found across outputs represent strong dissatisfaction.
   - Category is unanimously ""battery operation_performance"".
   - Although one agent gave an intensity score of -4, the predominant sentiment intensity is -5 due to repetition and context of the negative sentiment across several statements.

2. **Group 2 (Picture Quality):**
   - Consensus across agents that ""picture quality"" is praised (Aspect Term: ""picture quality"").
   - Opinion consistently expressed as ""very good"", categorized as ""display quality"".
   - Sentiment polarity and intensity are consistently positive and scored at 4.

3. **Group 3 (YouTube App):**
   - Agreement on application ""youtube app"" having issues, affecting user experience (Aspect Term: ""youtube app"").
   - Opinion phrases point toward extreme dissatisfaction (""really sucks"", ""Useless"").
   - The intensities and sentiment polarity are consistently negative with a score of -5.
   - Reconciling the variance in category (""software quality"", ""software operation_performance"", ""software usability"") to ""software quality"" given that agents' thematic focus aligns mostly toward quality concerns over functionality or usability issues."

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Headset Sentiment (Group ID 1):** All three agents agree on the positive sentiment and the intensity is most agreed upon at a strong positive (5). The category is ""multimedia_devices general"", as used by two agents.

2. **Connection Sentiment (Group ID 2):** The aspect term varied slightly (""connects"" vs. ""connection"") - ""connects"" was chosen as it matched the sentence structure. The sentiment and intensity are consistent across agents with a category of ""multimedia_devices connectivity"".

3. **Controls Sentiment (Group ID 3):** All agents agree on the sentiment and intensity. For the category, ""multimedia_devices usability"" fits all analyses.

4. **Sound Sentiment (Group ID 4):** There is a discrepancy in categories but after evaluating all data, ""multimedia_devices quality"" with a sentiment intensity of 2 reflects the opinions better due to the word ""good"".

5. **Price Sentiment (Group ID 5):** While agents presented mixed sentiments, the prevailing sentiment is negative, with -1 as the average intensity. Categories related to price and statements mostly align with negative perception due to “a little pricey”."

**Explanation:**
- The first aspect, ""performance,"" was consistently identified across all agents with positive sentiment, with a focus on ""working good"" or ""awesome"" as opinion terms. Ultimately, the sentiments for ""performance"" were consolidated to ""laptop operation_performance"" with an intensity of 5, reflecting the consensus toward strong positivity.
- For the second aspect, ""product,"" sentiment unanimously suggested positivity (""Really love"", ""worth the money""). It was categorized under ""laptop price"" based on Agent 1's analysis. The intensity was set at 5 to reflect the overwhelming positive sentiment attached to the financial aspect.
- Discrepancies in the categories and minor opinion terms from various agents were resolved by prioritizing majority decisions and logical categorization within the context of the input document."

The good....
It is great for macro, holy smokes this thing is nearly a focused microscope for thing like coins and jewelry. It actually works so well it make it hard to light your subject since you can get so close.

The fisheye is massive on the field of view.

The lens cap is a great fit and used all the time.

The bad......

The wide angle lens is blurry around the edges, not crisp all through the frame

The case is flimsy even when screwed down and the screws will vibrate out of the case if not kept in check.

The threads are iffy so take your time putting on the lenses the first time.","Based on the analyses provided by the three LLM agents, I have consolidated the results into a final unified conclusion.

765,"I got tired of the cheap canon bag deluxe 200 eg.

I found this bag to be perfect to my equipment:

NIKON D5100 WITH BATTER GRIP
TOKINA 11-16
NIKON 70-300
NIKON 35
CANON HV40
MINOLTA 7000 ANALOG
MACBOOK AIR 15""

It's well padded, strips are confortable, great design, beautiful, excellent protection for your expensive gear.

Only con, This one seemed like a huge bag, however if you have a battery grip or another big camera, you might as well think
buying a bigger one because i have issues trying to fit mi tokina (hood included) with my 5100 and battery grip all together because it's not
that wide in the camera compartment, so that's the only complaint I have, however it's not a deal breaker since this is a minor
flaw that can be overpassed since the bag it's great in many other aspects.

Excellent buy!!!","```json

- **Group 1:** The aspect term ""canon bag deluxe 200 eg"" was commonly identified along with the opinion ""cheap,"" leading to a negative sentiment in the ""out_of_scope general"" category, consistently rated at -2.
- **Group 2:** ""Equipment compatibility"" with the opinion ""perfect"" was rated positively, and although ratings varied slightly across agents, a moderate positive intensity score of 4 and the ""out_of_scope usability"" category is a balanced conclusion.
- **Group 3:** The ""bag design"" was universally seen positively with strong opinions consistently rated at 5 across agents, in the ""out_of_scope design_features"" category.
- **Group 4:** A blend of both a larger design appreciation (“huge” perceived neutrally by most agents) and a specific ""camera compartment size"" issue, with the opinion ""not that wide"" leading to a slight negative intensity of -1, aligns across multiple agents categorically considered as ""out_of_scope usability.""
- **Group 5:** ""Purchase satisfaction"" captures the essence of the ""Excellent buy!!!"" sentiment, with a consistent positive intensity rating of 5 in the ""out_of_scope general"" category."

767,"I bought this camera because it had underwater capbilites,and we were taking our computer on vacation and I thought it would be fun to review some pictures as the trip progressed.  Considering the price..this camera did great! We snorkled everyday...and got some great shots...you can't expect wonders, but I was plesantly surprised. We photographed a sleeping sea turle, sting rays, and lots of little reef fish...all were clearly visible, some well lit and very colorful, others blurry.  The kids loved seeing themselves snorkling. I have an old underwater Canon (sureshot- 35mm) which takes better pictures....but this camera just gave us another option. Our outdoor pictures came out pretty good, too...although, as the other reviewer said...conditions have to be just right to get good pictures.
This camera is not without it's faults.  Like any cheap piece of electronics it occasionally does crazy stuff.  The last day diving we lost our pictures, because one of the kids may have pressed the wrong buttons in some sequence...or...the batteries ran out...or the camera program just froze.  Battery life does seem a little short..and if they die...you lose your pictures..which is a bummer. The pictures can also be somewhat ""pixely,""  especially if you zoom in and crop closely.
My 10 year old loves this camera..and we have had lots of fun with it.  It's small, lightweight, and waterproof in the case.

769,"I'm a systems engineer at a relatively large company, so I'm writing this review from that perspective only. VMware, Hyper-V, ConfigMgr 2012, concerns like that. I'll be RDP'd into 10-20 systems at a time, not always through mRemote. Running this device on Windows 8, the T650 works pretty well. I'm not impressed with gesture functionality. ""Wait, do I drag with four fingers or three?"" Takes a bit of time to get used to them and frankly, I find the hotcorners more than enough for my purposes. Besides...I don't know many people that do what I do even bothering to use the new Start screen (aka ""Metro"" interface). We still live in the desktop.

Bringing up the charms by dragging from the edge....works maybe one out of four times. Almost like its set to ignore that gesture lest it get inadvertently repeated.

Where gestures really fall over, as I hinted at before, is when you are RDP'd into something. Of course, that is NO fault of the Logitech software. But it is something to keep in mind. I've got three screens, two of them with RDP sessions open, another for Outlook / Skype / Lync. It takes more work to use gestures in those circumstances.

I'm able to navigate between all three screens relatively quickly. About as accurate as my mouse and not much need for backtracking or overshooting the target. Its great for using Lightroom.

Everyone complaining about click and drag needs to spend more time with this unit before giving up. Use your thumb to hold, your finger to drag. Works fine.

Placement of the T650 is an issue. I cannot get comfortable with it. Maybe I'm simply too used to my mouse. I keep dropping two fingers on the surface of the T650, inadvertently double clicking on something or activating a gesture. Holding three fingers in the air, with another running across the surface of the trackpad, because of its size, gets difficult if running through large spreadsheets or moving objects from my right screen to the left screen.

I suspect after a few more weeks, I'll go back to my mouse and give up on this experiment. It would be nice if I didn't live on my desktop 10 hours a day.","[

781,This product it really awesome! First off the Bluetooth connection syncs perfectly with my Ipad Mini no delay or anything and I love how it turns my ipad on or off when I open and close it whether or not the keyboard is on or not. The only thing I had to get use to was the size of the keyboard because of its small size but that should be expected considering it is the ipad mini and also this is the product that apple recommends for the ipad mini on their website and it is a hit! I love it! I actually bought this case along with Aduro Facio Case with Bluetooth Removable Keyboard for Apple Ipad Mini and I have been unable to use it yet because I love this one so much!!!!,"```json

783,"I personally wanted to give this a 2 star... but then I had to consider the price and gave it a 3 star.

The volume f11 and f12 do not work.
The nearly four inch wrist rest is to deep, its very uncomfortable to type when sitting at the table with this laptop ( the edges are actually sharp).

It has a overall ""cheap"" feeling ...I guess because it is inexpensive  ( I keep trying to remember that fact).
I do like the size of the touch pad, but the buttons don't feel like they will last.
I am not a fan of the low profile keyboard either ( however all newer computers seem to have them now).

It did boot up fine ... and the computer itself seems to be working well ( this is my 3 Dell, so I'm a repeat customer)  but the case/ or shell appears substandard.

So if this is back up ...or if you are using it with a TV, I'm sure its a great buy ....if its for everyday use, this may not be the one. ( I'll update this review in a month or so ...after I have used it for a while).

 I am trying to tell myself I will get used to windows 8 ....so far I don't believe myself.

***************
 I want to update my review ,  I have decided to return this laptop.  With the 2 function keys not working and and the right button on on the mouse pad sticking ....  I decided that it had to much against it , for a BRAND new computer. ( even a inexpensive one).

I was unsure about my ability to return the defective laptop , because it was not actually ""dead on arrival""  and I had used it for several days ...  I sent a detailed message to Amazon , and in less than 24 HR I was sent a return label.

I have always been 100% pleased with AMAZON and with this situation they rose to the occasion.  I am slightly concerned , because the ""reason"" for the return on the label says ""different from what was ordered""  and that is not the case ... other than I ordered a laptop that should not be defective.  I am hopeful that the return process goes well ... and I look forward to buying a new laptop as soon as my credit it processed .","```json

### Explanation and Final Consensus:
- **Aspect Term:** The term ""unit"" is recognized by all three agents in the context of the overall product, leading to its categorization under ""laptop general.""
- **Aspect Category - Laptop Usability:** The term ""use"" specifically reflects usability, distinctly noted by Agent 2, reinforcing its presence separate from the general impression of the unit. ""soooo simple"" is consistently positive across agents.
- **Aspect Category - Sound:** The term ""sound"" is consistently identified by all agents with similar sentiment polarities and intensities. For the category, ""multimedia_devices operation_performance"" is chosen as it aligns with both operational performance and the evaluative context provided.
- **Sentiment Intensity:** Scores align across agents for unit and sound, with minor differences in operation vs. quality distinctions; the highest majority or average consensus-driven score was selected, maximizing clarity and objectivity."

794,"This is close to being a perfect example of a wearable/mountable POV camera. But unfortunately, close isn't quite good enough.

The pros:
Video is awesome, in all of the modes.
Stills are very good quality, the timelapse feature is fantastic.
It's waterproof.
The mounting options are (almost) limitless.

The cons:
It's awkward to set up. Menu is like something from 20 years ago.
Firmware issues have yet to be addressed by the manufacturer. This is inexcusable as the camera has been available for sale for nearly a year.
Audio is useless. They could have saved weight and cost by just not including a mic. The only instance where it even sort of works is when mounted right near a loudish sound you want to highlight, such as an engine.
There are too many instances where ""Macgyvering"" is required to get the desired result. The quick release mount rattles so you need to tape the base plate, the non waterproof back allows too much wind noise, so you need to tape over the openings, the shutter button rattles, so you need to tape over that. Moral of the story: BUY TAPE.
The support by the manufacturer is not quite adequate. I realize it's a small start up company, but for all the issues with the use of the camera and the handling/editing of the files, they really need to release some conclusive videos or articles to address these concerns.

People who might find this camera useful:
Auto racing enthusiasts
Mountain Bikers
Sailors
Hobbyist videographers looking for those unique shots

People who will likely be disappointed and frustrated by this camera:
Pretty much anyone who thinks they'll be using it as a camcorder.
People who aren't really tech savvy and/or have an older computer
People who don't like to tinker and engineer solutions to make it do what they want.

******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE******* ******UPDATE*******
As of September 7, 2010, Gopro released the new firm ware for the camera. It seems to have fixed most of the bugs/issues. It also provides the option for upside down mounting.","```json

It fires uop your most used programs quickly towards the beginning but i think as you start using it the 8g of ssd becomes more clogged slowing it down a bit so then your back to having a 7200rpm HD. However for the price it did make me give it 4 stars because it has plenty of storage for what iu neeed and did somewhat increase speeds. If you really want to see the different every time you start up PC and open programs get a real SSD. If you need storage and a fast drive, get this. I edit photos and video and have not had any lag with this. Renders, load, opens etc much faster than some of the WD greens i use for quiet long term storage. I also have a couple other 7200pm drives and this is a little faster for sure.","[

801,"Pros-
-Great screen, not too much glare for a glossy screen, amazing colors, and decent definition (1080)
-Beautiful design/style, entire thing only uses 3 metal plates, I still smile when I look at it
-All the internal parts are perfectly positioned so that your hands won't feel heat under loads
-Build quality is exceptional, everything fits together so nicely
-Swapping parts is quick and easy (and possible)
-More powerful than most desktops, the i7 and GTX 850m will handle pretty much anything out there.
-Has an ASUS logo on the back that lights up when the laptop's on
-All major ports are on the left side, so there won't be any wires bothering your mouse (assuming your right handed)
-DVD/optional blu ray player (which can be replaced with an additional hard drive bay if needed)
-It's about $XXX cheaper than most other laptops with the same specs, It really is a great deal
-Boots surprisingly fast considering the 5400rpm HDD
-Quiet machine even with fans running at max speed
-Discrete fans, air flows in through 2 small vents under it, and out through the back where the monitor axis are
-Everything about this laptop has a very high quality feel, even the charging brick.
-Decent sound quality, the mini sub woofer helps
-I have never seen goat simulator run smoother than on this machine, most games on max will go 60fps+
-Battery life is alright I guess it should last through a few lectures or classes

Cons-
-Backlit keyboard sprays light all around the keys, and depending on the angle is brighter than the letters
-The shift key came slightly tilted to the left (minor detail)
-The left arrow is about 0.1mm lower than the other keys (minor detail)
-The stickers on it (Intel i7, Energy star, and GTX 850m) were tilted at a slightly off angle (minor detail)
-I had to buy a t5 screw head to open the back to add more ram (it only comes with 8gb, but there's and empty slot) (minor detail)
-Indicator lights (like for power/wireless/blutooth/etc) are small and not very visible. (minor detail)
-Battery is good considering the power, but still is only 2-5 hours depending on what you're running
-HDD running at 5400rpm kinda sucks, but it's replaceable so whatever, at least its a quiet one
-Only one built in hardrive bay, if needed you can replace the DVD thingy with a bay (minor detail)
-Its not free

I did my research on laptops (for a bit too long) and found that this was the best, the pros defiantly overwrite the cons. I really was unsure, I stared at the ""place order"" page for about 3 days, but it really was a good deal, and it was sooo worth it. It does have flaws, but they are all very minor and don't really make a difference. This really is the best laptop that you'll get for under 2 grand.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **General Offering:** All agents agree on the strong positive sentiment towards the overall experience. The category ""laptop general"" is selected to encompass the general praise.
   
2. **GPU Power:** A consistent negative sentiment about GPU power is noted across all agents, hence maintaining the ""graphics operation_performance"" category.

3. **Battery Life:** ""Battery operation_performance"" with positive sentiment is consistent throughout results from all agents.

4. **System Files and Storage:** The discrepancy in categorizing ""system files"" versus ""storage"" is resolved by considering the focus on storage impact. ""OS operation_performance"" seems fitting for system files' storage consumption with a slight negative sentiment.

5. **Storage:** Concerning low storage and sd card mitigation, ""hard_disc operation_performance"" with negative sentiment is retained.

6. **CPU and RAM:** Consensus exists on the positive impression of CPU and RAM, aligned under ""cpu operation_performance.""

7. **Overall Satisfaction:** The ""give a A"" statement indicates satisfaction; therefore, using ""laptop quality"" suggests overall impression and evaluation, with a positive sentiment.

In summary, the final output incorporates the collective observations of the agents, prioritizing consensus while refining categories for precision."

827,"My car is a 2004 and the radio can't handle MP3 CDs.  This gadget works great.  Sure, the sound suffers a bit under the limited bandwidth of FM radio, and your options to navigate and chose songs are pretty limited.  I wish you could actually see the track and album info on the device, which would make searching for music soooo much easier.  I play from the SD card and have about 1.5GB of music on it that I totally like, so I let it shuffle (random choice of songs on the SD card) and that works absolutely perfect for me.
As its power is obviously from the 12V board power of the car, be aware how the outlet of your car is wired.  Mine provides power even with ignition off and keys removed - so pull it out when your leaving the car unattended for many days, and I pause it to not play continuously when I leave the car.

Its a 4star because of the Purple fringing on high contrast shots.

Macro mode gives awesome photos...

In this consolidated output:

1. The aspect term ""price"" is consistently identified with a positive sentiment across all agents. The intensity score of 4 is a moderate-to-strong positive sentiment reflecting the text's context.

2. The aspect term ""kappa reference series"" is treated as out-of-scope for category general sentiment by agents 1 and 2, which matches the context, and thus the negative sentiment polarity with an intensity of -3 is preserved.

3. For the ""sound quality"" aspects related to performance, combining the agents' inputs, a strong positive sentiment is suitable due to consistent terms like ""great sounding,"" ""huge wattage,"" and ""impressive bass,"" reaching an intensity score of 5.

4. The sentiment related to installation in the user's Tacoma is overwhelmingly positive as reflected by ""loooove it,"" aligning it to multimedia_devices usability with the strongest positive intensity score of 5."

**Consolidated Conclusions:**

1. **Fit:** There is a consistent negative sentiment across agents regarding the laptop's fitting, which is confirmed to be ""does not fit"", ""loose"", and that the ""bottom... falls off."" This negative sentiment is strongest given the multiple issues raised, justifying a sentiment intensity score of -4 under the ""laptop design_features"" category.

2. **Other Brands:** The sentiment for other brands is consistently positive across all agents, with the aspect recognized as fitting well. Hence, a sentiment intensity score of 2, categorized under ""company general"", reflects this positivity appropriately.

3. **Return Policy:** The sentiment here is negative, focusing on the inability to return and having to ""pay for another one."" This suggests dissatisfaction with return policies or associated costs. The category ""support operation_performance"" aligns with this aspect, with a sentiment intensity score set to -3.

4. **Returning to Other Brand:** The sentiment about considering going back to another brand, identified as a ""top case"", is positive. However, due to varying opinions on intensity, a moderate sentiment intensity score of 2 is chosen, reinforcing the positive viewpoint under the ""company general"" category."

841,"This is a good overall card if you don't need to the speed, but you can find many other models that will match the speed of this card.

Basically Lexar is claiming a maximum write speed of 90MB/s, this is completely false through all of my testing. The claim of a 45MB/s write speed is also false.

As a control, I was using a SanDisk 16GB 30MB/s card.

Using Crystal Disk Mark:

Lexar 600x  |  Sandisk 233x

Read [MB/s}, Write [MB/s]  |  Read [MB/s}, Write [MB/s]

31.18,  22.83  |  31.07,  28.01

As you can see, the 2 year old regular Sandisk scored better than the Pro Lexar card in write speed. Keep in mind I was using the Lexar Pro USB 3.0 reader.

This is a valuable metric, but it isn't always telling. It was time to test the card head to head in my camera.

Canon EOS 60D: 10 Raw Shots, Time to clear buffer. ""The ultimate test""

The Sandisk scored an average of 10.85 seconds to clear the buffer in my 60D. The Lexar took 10.92 seconds, a tie.

The next test is where I thought the lexar would come into it's own. The primary marketing fact on this page ^^^ is that the Lexar is superior in transfer speed to the computer, nope.

Transfering the same 20 Raw shots to the computer using USB 3.0 Pro Lexar reader.

Sandisk: 13.55 seconds
Lexar: 13.56

Another tie.

--------

Conclusion, and other metrics.

I am shocked that my $14 Sandisk tied with this $70 card, it even beat it in some instances. So, I would absolutely recommend the $14 Sandisk Extreme ""HD Video"" card over this one. If you want the speed. Get the Sandisk Extreme Pro cards. They are simply the fastest.

Regardless of speed, the Lexar seems likes a solid card, build quality is high and get noticeably less hot than other cards. I did a few ""corruption tests"" such as ripping the card out of the reader when it was still reading from the card. Even under these circumstances, the card never delivered a corrupt image. (A problem I have had in the past with SanDisk). It is for these reasons that the cards receives a rating of ""3 stars"". Otherwise, steer clear. You can get a way better deal on a SanDisk (or probably other brand).","```json

**Explanation:**

1. For the first aspect ""computer"", two out of the three agents classified it as ""laptop general"", and all agents agreed on a strong positive sentiment with a score of 5. Hence, the category ""laptop general"" is chosen, along with the opinion term ""Great computer!!!"" as presented.

2. The second aspect ""screen touch"" consistently appeared with the opinion terms ""love"" and ""works great"" (or ""great""), and a positive sentiment intensity score of 4 across all agents. The category ""display usability"" is unanimously agreed upon, and thus it is used in the final consolidated conclusion.

3. The third aspect concerning ""work at home"" did not have any opinion terms and held a neutral sentiment with a score of 0. The majority agreed on the category being ""out_of_scope"", with one agent specifying ""general"" and another ""operation_performance"". Considering the nature of the statement ""I use for work at home"", the ""out_of_scope general"" category is chosen as it is more fitting."
857,"I've only had this a few days, but my initial impressions are very positive.

Basically it does everything you would expect it to do.  Power it on, connect to your computer, load it with content, download the app, set your device's wi-fi connection to connect to the wi-drive, start the app...and that's it.

Within the first hour - the USB connection for pushing content to it is sloooooow - I had an iphone, ipod touch and my Kindle Fire streaming 3 different movies perfectly well.

What I especially liked on the Kindle is you get a list of the movies!!  No more guessing with that stupid, idiotic Gallery view in the Kindle App that only shows you thumbnails and forces you to guess the movie!

It's not a full, true, wi-fi connection - so I couldn't get it to stream well from 50 feet away - but since you'll likely be sitting right next to it, you should be fine.

Battery life is actually going to be the limitation at around 4 hours (I believe), but checkout other reviews as people have discovered a workaround to get it to charge whilst streaming (which it doesn't want to do natively).","```json

**Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term and Categories:** 
   - ""inflatable screen"" was consistently recognized as related to overall value and quality, and hence categorized under ""multimedia_devices general"" as per Agent 3, the only agent linking it to a relevant category in the predefined list.
   - ""setup process"" (Agent 3) seemed the best fit under ""multimedia_device usability"", highlighting the ease of use based on matching opinions from all agents.
   - ""usage scenarios"" was aggregated from Agent 3's analysis and matched with the high opinion sentiment.
   - ""cost comparison"" was a neutral perception across agents, linked under ""multimedia_devices price"" considering comparative cost messages.
   - ""purchase confidence"" captured the positive sentiments about the overall transaction, best aligning with ""multimedia_devices quality"" considering the sentiment towards the trustworthiness and confidence expressed in the purchase.

2. **Opinion Term and Sentiment:**
   - Opinion terms were derived by consolidating visible sentiment expressions across agents. Positive sentiments or cost-related statements were used in aspects such as the screen's worth and purchase confidence.
   - Sentiments were classified as positive or neutral consistently across the board, with only intensity adjustments for score alignment.

3. **Sentiment Intensity:**
   - Intensity scores were calibrated to reflect a consolidated judgment where agents either agreed or where one agent's analysis was notably more descriptive and informative.

861,"This device works fine and serves my purpose in conjunction with a Flight Simulator. It gives me a keyboard very close so that the whole operation is more effective. It does not have a volume control and that I wish it did have. The mouse pad works fine. Others have commented that it was too sensitive. It goes to sleep about every 2 - 3 mins if not used, but a simple tap of a key awakens it. It has an on/off switch underneath to save on the battery......","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

868,I truly enjoy using this mouse. It has such a good ergonomics and I have no complaints about the size of it as a 6 foot tall person. I have one minor and one major reason to give it a 4 stars.  The major one is it's battery type which is AAA batteries. I wish it carried a single AA battery rather than two AAAs to run because It might be annoying to find spare AAAs at home. The minor one is the sloppy on and off knob of the mouse. Well it just does the job but has a very plasticy feel.,"```json

### Explanation:
- **Group 1** shows that there is consensus among the agents that the cost aspect is positively perceived with the sentiment category of ""laptop price.""
  
- **Group 2** identifies the ""options"" positively recognized, supported by the opinions from agents 1 and 3. The category ""laptop design_features"" is agreed by agent 3 and complements the aspect term ""options.""

- **Group 3** concerns the ""trackpad,"" which is expressed negatively. Agent 2 breaks down the concerns into usability and operation performance issues with varying intensities, whereas agent 3 considers a broader usability category. By synthesizing, a consensus on ""hardware usability"" with an average intensity score of -2 is determined, striking a balance between agent 2 and agent 3's -3.

- **Group 4** deals with the ""rechargeable battery."" All agents agree on a neutral sentiment with a focus on design features. There’s a unanimous agreement on the sentiment polarity and intensity score, as reflected in the final output."

871,"I wanted to purchase a gaming laptop and this laptop fit exactly what I wanted.

The feel and looks of it are fantastic. I love backlit keyboards so that was a plus.

It runs my games perfectly well (League of Legends on High at around 120fps, Overwatch on Medium at around 70fps, and processes games like Civ 5 and Sins of a Solar Empire quickly) and without effort.

Startup is incredibly quick (Gotta love Solid State!) but you may notice that the signing in process (Windows 10) kinda takes a bit but I don't believe that to be due to the laptop. Also, sometimes that process is faster than other times.

The final consolidated output reflects a synthesis of the findings from the three agents, differentiated by clarity and agreement on the aspect terms, sentiment intensity, and categorization. Each aspect's sentiment polarity and intensity score were reconciled based on alignment among the results provided by the agents. Overall, the intensely positive sentiment towards the 'hard drive' and 'computer' performance improvements was consistent, while the sentiment score for 'ram' was slightly adjusted towards the moderate range. The aspect and category links were determined for clarity and alignment with the input text."

Great computer at a real good price. I searched for months before finally picking this computer and I am really happy with my choice!!!  :)

**Explanation:**
1. For the ""programs"" aspect term, all three agents agree on the positive opinion ""good"" and ""up to date,"" with a sentiment intensity score of 2. However, there is a difference in category assignment. Most agents assigned ""software operation_performance,"" which seems most fitting given the context that it's about the programs being up to date.

2. Regarding the ""performance"" aspect, Agents 1 and 3 agree on categorizing performance issues as part of ""laptop operation_performance"" and indicated strong negative sentiment, which is consistent across the agents. The consolidated output reflects this shared stance.

3. For the ""purchase"" aspect term, while the categories across agents were varied, the sentiment and opinion term are consistent, with all agents assigning a strong negative sentiment. I opted for the ""laptop general"" category, which provides a more holistic assessment of dissatisfaction encompassing both the product and its performance implications."

It didn't come with the computer, and I have been trying to get the seller's attention ever since. NO REPLY AT ALL.

And the advertise said ""SEVEN HOURS"". Not true. I doubt this seller is going to do anything, so I am gonna try Dell.com and see if I get better luck there.

This computer blows away ALL of my friends computer by far its just insane! I used to have a HP Pavilion a1010n it had 512mb RAM, 3ghz processor, and like 32mb Video card and when i upgraded i was AMAZED at the difference of speed and graphics as far as games are concerned. My friend thinks that i got ripped off i was like no way. He asked me what the processor speed was and he was like no theres no way your probably thinking of like 2.3ghz. Seriously get this computer it is a BEAST. Plus on the top its like a very nice rubber padding that dips in a bit so you can set stuff up there (wallet, modem, phone, etc.) It doesnt allow anything to slide off or scoot around.

901,"This worked straight out of the box. Spent maybe 5 min installing the memory in my Macbook Pro 2011 (with the help of youtube).
Worked perfectly after restart.

Did wonders with Aperture and some other apps. It used to be sooo slow. It was painfully frustrating to do RAW photo editing. Like wading through an ocean of molasses. But now it flies compared to the previous 4GB system.
Maybe Apple should consider shipping their MBPs with 8 GB RAM as default?
Thanks.","```

903,"I bought these as a potential upgrade to the Koss Porta Pros that I have been using for many years. In my opinion sound quality and clarity were very good, but only almost as good as the less expensive Porta Pros.  My main complaint about the ATH-FC700As is that they were very uncomfortable for me to wear for any extended period of time. In order for the ATH-FC700As to provide some sound isolation (there is some sound leakage) they clamp down pretty tightly. After about an hour or so they started hurting my ears, whereas with the Porta Pros I'm able to adjust the tension of the ear pieces and they are comfortable all day (I use them all day while working at my computer). My suggestion is if you like the style and are only going to wear your headphones for an hour or two at a time then these are a good choice, but if you are like me and use your headphones for extended periods of time there are better options out there that cost much less such as the Porta Pros.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Koss-PortaPro-Headphones-with-Case/dp/B00001P4ZH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Koss PortaPro  Headphones with Case</a>","```json

So the mains issue i have is that this monitor is for consoles, I don't play games on consoles I prefer to game on pc's.  But doing research and watching video review I could of found out this ahead of time.  The ghosting on my unit had very bad ghosting which is very noticeable even during gaming and even worse on text on webpages.  While disabling ama does help this but doing so causing another problem like fuzz during movement, so I decided to return this display.  Yes the image is nice the colors are decent but for pc I would not recommend this product.  I work on my computer and play games as much as I can and cant see myself continuing using this display with these issues, but those with consoles its definitely a decent choice.  So I hope I can help someone out there that don't make the same mistake that i did, while the price is very compelling you got to ask yourself especially if your going to use it for pc, can you deal with the possibility of having the same issues and can you live with it?  There are some greater options out there definitely do the research before the purchase thank you!!!!","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

Update used this for 1 year and it was awesome, but since i was able to get a EVGA 1060 SC on amazon I sold it, undercutting every other seller by $20 because i can not believe people are still buying these at the prices on here, the used prices ae what i paid new. unbelievable.

**Reconciliation and Notes:**
- **Aspect Terms and Categories:** Reconciled from agents which identified ""computer"" under ""laptop general"" with positive sentiment due to consistent strong positive opinions. ""Macbook"" and ""Pro"" indicated neutral sentiments related to decision-making rather than opinion on product quality or performance, confirmed by multiple agents.
  
- **Opinion Terms:** A diverse range of positive expressions were used consistently across agents to describe the computer, thus all captured directly. The term ""SMOOTH"" pertains more to performance linking it with ""laptop operation_performance"" due to its contextual use, but agent consensus linked it with the general laptop evaluation.

- **Sentiment Intensity Scores:** Majority consensus leaned towards extreme positive impressions and one consistent slight negative for price, thus mirroring Agent 1 and 2 with a final neutral stand on battery life due to variation in agent reporting. 
  
- **Consistency Notes:** Identification of aspects and sentiments were aligned as per dominance of shared results across agents, ensuring collective integrity in conclusion."
