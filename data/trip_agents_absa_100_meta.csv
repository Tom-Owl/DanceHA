NO- because it is a homeless shelter. who wants to take pictures of that??? DO NOT STAY HERE.","[

3,"When I was looking for hotels in Chicago most that I came across cost waaaay more than the Holiday Inn. I was grateful when I found such reasonable prices considering the prices of the other hotels in the area. I was so excited to find that the hotel was exceptionally nice considering the price which makes it a no brainer as to where we will stay any time we visit Chicago! We had a nice view of the city and the river below, our room was spacious, clean, and the bed and pillows were sooo comfortable! Being attached to the Merchandise Mart was great because we could walk to coffee shops without having to go outside, and being able to walk to the metro through the Merchandise Mart was great! A few blocks away is Lou Malnati's which has great deep dish pizza and on the bottom floor of the Merchandise Mart I really liked the blueberry muffin I had at Au Bon Pain. I am very happy with my experience and am grateful that I saved hundreds of dollars by staying here!","[

We immediately went up to our room, which was upgraded for us and the room was impeccable, beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotless. We had some travel hiccups getting to Seattle, so we were starving (and ready for a cocktail) by the time we checked in. We headed down to the Library Bistro for a drink and a bite to eat. The kitchen was technically closed by the time we got down there, but the chef agreed to still allow us to get something off of the appetizer menu, which we greatly appreciated. We also loved the location-quick access to the waterfront and Pike's Place Market. We absolutely loved staying here and would definitely stay here again!!!","[

13,The only thing good about this hotel is its close to everything. (like many other hotels around) It's way overpriced. The bed was rock hard. No fridge. U had to pay for wifi and after over $200/ night that should be free!!! The check in people were not experienced. I wouldn't stay here again. The paint is cracked in ceiling. It was clean which is very impt but way overpriced for this place. We had a great time but that is bc it was up to us and Boston is great.,"[

14,"This hotel far exceeded me and my husband's expectations. We booked our room through hotwire.com and when we got there they upgraded us to a slightly larger room at no charge. Get this, we even had our 5 month old baby with us. Her packn'play fit conveniently in between our bed and the air conditioner which provided a lovely ""white noise"" to help the baby sleep. The beds are soooo comfy and the decore top notch paying attention to every little detail, nook, and cranny. For those saying that the rooms are tiny, they obviously didn't read about them before they booked. That's New York for you. The staff was much more friendly than I expected at such a stylish place and they had this wonderful service calle ""The Acura Service"". Tip: for a good and cheap breakfast go to the Cafe Metro just one block west or east of the hotel.","[

Scared of little old me??? Wow. Anyway, my experience at this hotel was not pleasant and I was inconvenienced by engineering multiple times and had to go off premise in order to get a meal. There buffet breakfast hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. so don't plan to be in your room late because they will try to snatch it from you when you go to breakfast. Check out suppose to be at noon but the housekeepers discourage you staying until then with all of the noises they make at 7:00 a.m. waking up all of the guests.

The bell-hop offering assistance... And the front desk clerks busily tended to each customer in a very personal yet expeditiously manor. I enjoy SF mostly because of the wonderful accomodations I am afforded when staying with the Hotel Whitcomb... One more very important point I would like to add is the visibility and availability of the management staff...

23,"My son and I had a wonderful week long stay at the Omni on our vacation. The front desk staff, security, food service and housekeeping were very friendly and professional. We had a bay/cityview room on the 19th floor that limited the train noise and provided awsome views. Join Omni select guest for free wi-fi, two freee beverages in the morning by room service, and 2 presed items. I would also recommend self parking at the ACE lot at K and 6th for $8 weekday and walk a half block to the hotel instead of the $30 plus tip valet parking that is offered by the hotel. The hotel has earned their 4 star rating and I would absolutely stay here when I come back to San Diego.","[

24,"After spending our first night at the Hotel Pennsylvania, we knew we were in the right area of NYC but definitely in the WRONG hotel. After a quick search, we packed our bags and headed to the Radisson just a block away. The front desk management and staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. They had us setup with a room and even provided a complimentary breakfast coupon while we waited on our room to be cleaned.
Ahhh - the room. What a difference it made in our trip to have a room with clean new carpet, sleep number beds, nice tv's with a good selection of channels, soft bath towels, free wireless internet, and a staff that is ready to serve you at all areas of the hotel.
The location is perfect if your looking for great subway access, walking distance to Time Square...
I would absolutely recommend this hotel and plan on staying there on my next trip to NY.","[

25,"seriously one of the best hotels I've stayed in. i'm a 20 year old girl who was traveling alone and I was sooo relieved when I arrived at this lovely establishment. the staff was very friendly, my room was super clean, and the location of this place could not be better!! it's a very short walk to the subway, multiple bus stops, and the famous cable car line. it's also near a lot of great shopping, the museum of modern art, and lots of places to eat. i felt very welcomed, cozy, and safe for the 3 nights i stayed here. I stayed in an economy room (a single room with a shared bath) and I was a little hesitant to share a bath but everything was always clean and i never had to wait to shower, etc.
I would definitely stay here again, without hesitation.","[

30,"My husband and I always stay at the Admiral Fell Inn every time we go to Baltimore. We always have a great time and no complaints about the hotel. Everyone is always nice and the room is always clean. We stayed on St. Patty's day weekend. The weather was horrible the whole time but at least we still had a great time, except for getting our car locked in the PMI parking garage because they are closed on Sundays and they don't tell you that before you park there and then when you go to leave on Sunday you find out that your really not leaving until Monday after 6 am! But luckily someone had a monthly pass to the parking garage and let us in and out and we didn't have to pay for parking, Saved us alot of money. But anyway, we had a great time and always do every year and we will definitely be back next year!!!!","[

32,"This was one of the best hotels I've very stayed in. Everyone on the staff was extremely nice to me. I was at a conference at another hotel, so I was coming in late and tired. The staff made sure there were snacks left for me. They all gave me great recommendations for fun things to do around town, and treated me like a friend. The breakfast was fabulous, and the very kind man who ran it kept it stocked even when it was packed with hungry guests. My room was spotless, and the cleaning staff gave me refills on all my soaps every night. We called ahead to ask if they had a refrigerator in the room: Apparently they will in the future for all guests, but for that trip they actually put one in my room!!!! I used the indoor pool, which was conveniently open late, and just perfect for laps. This made my business trip feel like a luxury vacation!","[

33,"We were very pleased with the one week stay we just had at the Opal. Upon arriving, we were told that they were upgrading us to a suite for the night at no charge because they were out of king beds as we had requested for the first night. We found the hotel staff very friendly, and proficient. The breakfast was very good and the location was great, we took the bus down to Fisherman's wharf for 1.50 and it came right in front of the hotel. We either took the bus or walked to many other locations as well. We really enjoyed the restaurants located nearby, Tommy's Joynt was just great, Chevy's Mexican down a few blocks on Van Ness had $3.00 drink and appetizer specials Mon. - Friday, can't be beat!!!!

36,"I had the BEST experience at the Hilton Garden Inn - downton, which could have gone soooo negative. Accidentally locked my key clicker in the car. Valet Sean could not reopen the car with the key. He went out of his way to find a kit to get inside and unlock the vehicle and found the clicker underneath the seat.
IF it were not for Valet Sean, I may have had to spend $$$ for a locksmith and spend the night at the hotel.
Thank you SEAN for going above and beyond to help a hotel guest!!! You deserve a ""customer service"" award!!!!

39,"My family stayed here for two nights (including my 5-1/2 year old granddaughter). The staff was great and I can't say enough about the knowledge of their concierge, Lolly! All we had to do was tell her what we were in the mood for and she had recommendations, directions and prices for what we chose. She was great since we were there to enjoy the beautiful city of Seattle!
Excellent location, walking distance to some cool restaurants and Pike Place and Starbucks every two doors was a big plus....but it's probably like that everywhere in Seattle! I will definitely stay at the Red Lion on 5th Avenue next time I visit.....and there will be a next time!","[

When we stayed there, the first room that we were put in had mold all over the walls - ick! We asked to be moved, and they did so. Our first night was okay, but the next morning we woke up only to find a dead cat on the path from our room to our car. We told the hotel staff about it and they told us that it would be taken care of as soon as possible. We came back several hours later only to find the dead cat STILL there.....

45,"I recently stayed in August, 2012 at this hotel for 5 nights, and found it to be extremely comfortable & very well managed. The staff are a credit to your organisation. Especially the room cleaners..... they are just fantastic. I was in room 782, which was newly refurbished and very quiet, which is sooooo important when u arrive very tired after a long international flight. The pool area is excellent and much better than any other airport I have stayed at recently. All in all I could not ask for more...............Thank u once again. I had a great stay. Millie1800.","[

There was no weather stripping on the doors or windows so all the traffic noise, and bugs got in. This was only the beginning, we stayed 6 nights, every night there was shouting on the staircases by our hotel door, drunken fools in the parking lot, and people with their t.v.'s blairing at 4 a.m., all which we complained about and recieved no help from the front desk. The room itself had torn and old comforters, stained walls and not very big at all. We have stayed on Hotel circle many times, and NEVER been so disappointed in a hotel as this last trip, I would never recommend this hotel to anyone, and even though you save a little money, it's not worth a goodnights sleep, and comfort...

47,"I had the pleasure of staying at the W in June for holiday with friends, stayed in a Mega room and was fantastic, the hotel was lovely and clean and experienced some great staff. The Whisky Blu is a great end to the night, one night we watched a single bar tender serving a full bar with no problems.
The room was great, lovely and spacious with an excellent seating area to relax, the bathroom was huge. Had a lovely welcome gift from the GM, Mr Maynard wich was also lovely.
Location is great, 10 mins from Times Square and a nice walk down 5th Ave to Central Park, I am returning again to celebrate New Years Eve and can't wait to go back!!!!","[

48,"During our honeymoon road trip, we stayed at The Argonaut for one night on 9/19. The location is awesome, and we had no problem pulling up at peak time in the afternoon and having our car picked up by the valet. 
Our room was decorated in a nautical theme, and had a view of the park next door and of the trolley turnaround. We didn't make it to the wine tasting that evening, but it sounded like a nice feature.
Beds were great, bathroom was great, and the minibar offered playing cards and other trinkets in addition to just snacks. There was also a DVD player available and free internet service.
Our window opened up, so it was nice to get some fresh air and to hear the sounds of the street. 
There's a nice courtyard area with a couple of bars and restaurants right next door if you don't want to go far, and that park has a little beach with a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge.
I'm already looking for excuses to stay here again on our next vacation. Highly recommend!!!","[

50,"I love staying here on my trips to D.C. It is close to everything and the nice ""apartment"" is like a home away from home. The management is very attentive - Vinh has been longtime manager and will go out of his way to meet every need. Here's the problem: The luxurious pillow-top bed makes it hard to get up and out on time. The spacious shower with multiple shower heads makes it difficult to take a quick shower. It is soooo quiet that you don't know the bustle of the D.C. is going on around you. There is a nice little store right around the corner that is the perfect place for great snacks when you want to skip your social events and park in front of the flat screen for the evening. If you don't have will power, this place will take you down. You will think you died and went to heaven.","[

59,"We spent five days in NYC and stayed at the Park Lane hotel, which has the best location and view in NYC at a good value. It is steps away from the subway and walking distance of most tourist attractions. 
The property is a little old and could use improvments in the bathrooms, furniture, mattresses and doors (there is an aprox 3 inch space between the doors and the floor so you get to hear a lot of noise!). Some improvents in the cleanliness of the rooms would be welcome as well as a quieter housekeeping staff that seems to forget that most guests are on holiday and want to rest and not be awoken by their extremely loud chatter everyday. 
Most of the staff are very friendly and service oriented. All our requests were tended to readily and professionally. The first night we hardly got any sleep because the bed was sooo soft, but we called housekeeping and they took care of it right away.
All in all the pluses outrank the minuses of this property. We will go back in our next trip.","[

65,"My Husband and I stayed here for the labour day long weekend. We have been travelling to NY city for almost 17 years but it was our first time at Giraffe. We liked the location, close proximity to everything. It was recommended by our friends who also love staying there.
The hotel itself is small and staff very personable. They serve a continental breakfast, there's an evening turn down service, a roof top patio which we didn't use because we weren't arounding during happy hour. Our room was very spacious, king bed with an adjacent sitting room and a little fridge in the room which we loved. Nice spot to return to after a full day of activities and shopping in Manhattan to relax and enjoy a cold beer or a nice glass of wine before dinner.
No relation to the hotel but there a fabulous restaurant next door Los Caminos, the food is sooo good and a must try is the red sangria.
Will be staying at Hotel Giraffe again.","[

Adjacent to Liberty Place with over 70 unique boutiques and restaurants and easily accessible to the convention center, 30th Street train station, and major universities. As a solo, woman traveler I felt safe. Great restaurant/bar in hotel with superior service and comfortable ambiance. Room was small but for a single business traveler it's perfect. Gym was great for quick cardio and a little weight lifting in the a.m. Filtered water dispenser on each floor. Lounge with coffee and tea, comfortable couches, local magazines/tourist info.

72,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before my move from Dubai to Chicago. It was the perfect place for my last two nights of living in Chicago. The location is fantastic...right next to the Grand stop on the Red Line, and just a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave. There are so many great restaurants surounding the hotel, including the Webber Grill, which is attached to the hotel.
Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Lots of great channels on the television, a coffeemaker, and a good hairdryer. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially with the 7 pieces of luggage we brought for my big flight/move to Dubai.
So, if you want a stellar downtown location and great Hilton quality and service, book this hotel. We were SOOO pleased!","[

Room is clear and comfortable.
View was perfect esp around 6 am you can witness the sunrise just in front of you.
We made our reservation over Priceline with $80/night-room.
I think it was a good deal.

75,"Our stay was absolutely delightful! They let us check in 4 hour earlier than check in time which was great. Unfortunately we didn't get the room with the harbor view but that was ok being that we were in the room so seldom. The staff always very kind, helpful and always had a smile. We really felt welcome. The lobby, pool area, fitness room and our room were very clean!!! Rooms are a nice size. We traveled with our kids, 13 & 8 years old and did not feel crammed. This hotel is convenient to everything!

The doors are not study and it was a crack so that you are able to see into the hallway-and if you can see you can hear believe me, I checked at least 11 doors.The pool was the worst!!!!! I looked and smell like sewage even if it did not you could not enjoy the lawn chairs everything was nasty.

84,"Friendly, professional, helpful staff. Great ammentites, spacious rooms, comfortable beds and nice TV. Staff is extremely helpful and exhaustes all efforts to meet your needs. My girlfriend forgot her cell phone charger at home, when we arrived at the hotel i asked the front desk staff if they might have a charger that would fit her phone, they sent one up within 15 minutes of our arrival. Great fitness center and PHENOMENAL bar on the 27th floor. Floor to ceiling windows with beautiful view of the Denver skyline. You would be hard pressed to find more bang for your buck when staying downtown. A legitimate FOUR STAR hotel at an affordable price, i highly recommend staying here, you will not be disappointed!!!","[

85,"Staying at Public Chicago is really an experience that I would highly recommend to others. The design aesthetic is chic and elegantly simple. Beautifully detailed and not overly designed. There are all the modern touches, but somehow it still has retained a sense of warmth that makes you truly feel welcome and at home (in a good way). 
The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and professional and they really made you feel like they were happy you were there. There are so many cool hotels, that have staff that make you feel like you are an unwelcome guest at their party, this was definitely not the case at Public. The common areas perhaps add to this welcoming feeling, the lobby, the library and restaurant were all very open and flowed into each other really nicely. 
I didn't eat there, but the design in the Pump Room was pretty awesome. While on the subject of food though, I loooooved the express room service concept, affordable and fast and the french toast was evil it was so good.
Neighborhood was beautiful, overall a really great way to spend some time in Chicago.","[

86,"My husband and I stayed here for 4 days for a convention and enjoyed every moment of it. Staff was great; especially Brian, the gentleman that brought our bags to our room and informed us of all the great places to go--beginning with the best food to be had a Reading Terminal Market, which is just across the street. There is a great little bar to the left of the lobby, in the hotel, that is friendly and busy, and they make wonderful white chocolate martinis! Everyone here was helpful and the hotel is quiet at night and in the mornings, if you can sleep in a bit--the beds are soooo comfortable; a cloud of soft sheets, down comforters and many pillows! If you are looking for good food, at a cool place, at a really decent price, call ahead and make a reservation at Bleu, in Rittenhouse Square. There is shopping and more restaurants even closer to the hotel , and a 7-11 convenience store right across from the entrance, for bringing snacks into your room. Will definitely stay here when we come to Philly again!","[
