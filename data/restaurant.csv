**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category for ""place"":** The term ""place"" is mentioned under both categories ""ambience general"" and ""location general"". However, considering the specific mentions of ""Sooooo good!!!"" and ""Super cute"", these sentiments align more with the atmosphere or experience (ambience), rather than location, as supported by Agents 1 and 2.

2. **Opinion Term for ""staff"":** All agents agree on the sentiment and categorization for ""staff"", maintaining consistency in sentiment description and aspect category.

3. **Opinion Term for ""server"":** All agents align in their sentiment expression and intensity, with minor differences in intensity scores being reconciled in favor of consensus at a score of 4. This retains balance across interpretations.

The consolidated output integrates evidence provided by all agents and reconciles differing sentiment intensities to best represent the collective analysis."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term ""place"":** Consensus among agents that ""place"" relates to the location as a general aspect. Given the strong expressions of sentiment like ""Love"" and ""fav"", and unity on the sentiment intensity around 5, the category settles on ""location general"" with the strongest intensity score.

2. **Aspect Term ""nachos"":** Agreement is evident regarding the aspect term being ""nachos"" related to ""food quality"". Sentiments reflect extreme positivity in all agent outputs. Though Agent 2 gave a sentiment intensity score of 4, the preponderance of evidence from Agents 1 and 3, both assigning a score of 5, indicates a consolidation to 5 for intensity.

**Note:** While Agent 2 introduced a category ""ambience general"", the repetition of ""place"" under the ""location general"" category by multiple agents, along with consistently strong sentiment terms and intensity scores, directs the conclusion towards ""location general"" for the aspect ""place""."

### Consolidated Conclusion:
1. **Waitress (Service General):** Across all agents, the sentiment towards the waitress was positive with ""5 Stars"" as the opinion term, and a sentiment intensity score of 4 reflects a strong positive opinion.
   
2. **Food (Food Quality):** Both negative opinions ""very bland"" and ""waaay over-priced"" were consistent across the analyses, aligning the aspect with ""food quality"" and scoring a -5, indicating a strong negative sentiment.
   
3. **Drinks (Drinks Quality):** Described as ""just okay"", the sentiment is neutral with an intensity score of 0, consistently classified under ""drinks quality"".

4. **Dining Experience (Restaurant General):** Identified only by one agent, but logically fitting with the overall sentiment, ""really excited"" and ""really disappointed"" indicate a negative sentiment toward the overall experience, with a moderate intensity score of -3."

**Explanation:**
- From the three LLM agents’ outputs, there were some variations in how the aspect terms and opinions were identified, especially between ""place"", ""restaurant"", and specific actions like ""recommendation"". Given the context of the text, ""place"" is the best overarching term to encapsulate all the positive sentiments about the restaurant entity as a whole under ""restaurant general"".
  
- The aspect regarding trying different ""places"" in Tampa was only identified explicitly by Agent 2, and it seemed out of place in the sentiment context assessed by other agents, hence its neutrality and position under ""location general"".

- The third aspect, ""food"", is reflected from the consistently identified positive sentiment towards its quality, particularly the term ""Sooooo good!"".

- The sentiment intensity score of 5 for the restaurant in ""restaurant general"" is corroborated by both agents 1 and 3, signifying a strong positive sentiment. The score for the location remains neutral, and the positive sentiment for food is similarly marked as a strong positive, following Agent 2’s high score."
15,"I have heard sooo many good things about this place and was really looking forward to it. We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and there was STILL a long line, so I was pretty convinced this would really impress me.

I got the chorizo queso to start off with and it was absolutely delicious, so all good there. But then I got my tacos and was disappointed. The hot chicken taco tasted nothing like hot chicken and had a weird flavor. The adobo chicken had a very basic flavor to it, indistinguishable from the shredded chicken you find at any local Mexican restaurant. Both tortillas were hard in odd places.

Maybe I should've gotten something that wasn't chicken, I don't know. But based on what I had, I can't understand the hype behind this place. If you want something similar but better, I recommend hitting up Local Taco.","Final ABSA Conclusion:

30,"The new spot that just opened up. Figured I'd give it a try,  regrettably, I must say,  should've made a different choice. First, I had to drive back and get the right burger, because instead of a mushroom swiss with jalapenos and bacon, they made a jalapeno burger, which did not look very appetizing... Upon returning home with the correct burger, I open it up to find half cooked bacon, which I just disposed of. Upon my first bite, it was a mix between soggy mush bun and a very flat grey looking patty. My wife at half of hers and couldn't even finish because ot felt like pure ""gut bomb"" as she called it. Overall, my experience was very ehhh, ""not so good"" burger. Also, perhaps they should invest in better staff.","```json

I had the Prosperity Club with sweet potato chips and they were sooo delicious! My companions had the beer cheese soup and the Hummus Three Ways. I will definitely recommend Alumni next time my workplace does a lunch out celebration. 

On a side note, I see in the reviews that dinner isn't as successful for people as it is for their lunch customers. Don't know why, different staff/managers, maybe? Plus, their person who comments on people's reviews needs to switch the comments up and also address the dissatisfied customers. It comes across as superficial otherwise. Just my thoughts as I was reading through.","```json

There are many sauces to choose from such as sirracha and a house sauce( yogurt and horseradish) and spicy barbecue sauce.

70,Since I've been going to piada the process has definitely changed. It from an Italian chipotle style of ordering to more standard menu items. I was told that if you order online you can customize it more. I personally Love the diavolo with the calamari and hot peppers. They're usually pretty fast inside and it's a very fun place to go for lunch. It's fast and delicious. If you're looking for a something extra totally try one the pepperoni piadas soooo good!,"[

### Final Conclusion and Justification:

1. **Aspect Term:** For the ""shakes,"" all three agents agreed on the term ""shakes"" as the aspect term.

2. **Aspect Category:** The category ""drinks quality"" is consistent with all agents for the ""shakes.""

3. **Opinion Term:** The combination of standout opinion terms—""Sooo good!"" and ""Highly recommend""—was selected as they capture the full sentiment towards the shakes, as seen in agents 2 and 3. 

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:** ""positive"" sentiment is given by all agents, with consistent intensity score of 5 from all agents, reflecting a strong positive sentiment.

5. **Service Aspect:** All agents identified ""service"" as the aspect term and ""service general"" as the category. Opinion terms, ""Awesome"" and ""very friendly,"" were chosen, accurately reflecting the sentiment. Although agent 3 slightly disagreed on the sentiment intensity score here, given consensus from the majority and context, a sentiment intensity score of 5 was concluded to reflect strong positive feedback."

Our beer was served in frozen, heavy old goblet glasses of my past. We had double cheeseburgers, fried mushrooms and onion rings, all served in red plastic baskets lined with deli paper. Our server asked us if we had been there before. We had not so she gave us a brief menu tour. The menu is on an old board on the wall.

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term**: Based on all agents' outputs, for ""Pizza & cheese steaks,"" I chose to treat it as a single aspect term as given in Agent 1's analysis. The intensity '5' was assigned considering the strong sentiment expressed and Agent 3's score.

2. **Aspect Term ""mixed cheese hoagie""**: Consistent across all agents, the sentiment intensity score is consolidated to '4' to reflect the average intensity perceived by Agents 1 and 3.

3. **Aspect Term ""hoagie rolls""**: Consistently recognized by all agents with a strong sentiment, maintaining Agent 1 and 3's intensity score of '5'."

When you walk in they are all sooooo sweet and happy. The food at the other tables  looked fresh and amazing. All we got was the waffle sundae, bacon, corn beef hash, tea and cocoa but everything was perfect! The strawberries were fresh and the corned beef hash was one of the best I've had.

**Reconciliation Notes:**
1. **Aspect Terms and Sentences:** There was broad consensus on the aspect terms and their corresponding sentences. Very similar terms were used across different agents for the aspects of food quality and the location.
   
2. **Categories:**
   - ""food"" was consistently considered under ""food quality"" across the agents and this was preserved.
   - There was a slight discrepancy in the categorization of ""homemade ice cream""; it was assigned both to ""food quality"" and ""food general"". Given the emphasis on both quality and general enjoyment of the ice cream, ""food quality"" was chosen due to the unanimous preference of quality.
   - ""Michoacana Grill"" was categorized either under ""location general"" or ""restaurant general"". Considering it encompasses more of a location context being a destination during their trip, ""location general"" was chosen.

3. **Opinion Terms and Sentiment Intensity:** There was consensus regarding the positive sentiment and its high intensity score, especially phrases expressing strong positivity such as ""SOOOO good"", ""great treat"", and ""Seriously amazing"". Scores of 4 or 5 were the most frequent, indicating strong overall experience satisfaction.

4. **Consolidation:** Due to the minor differences, careful integration was done to ensure that the aspect terms and categories appropriately matched the overarching analysis presented by all agents. Each opinion term provides a direct reference to specific sentiments, making their categorization and intensities aligned with the findings from all three agents."

We had the Epitome of Fabulosity (egg, sausage and cheddar cheese) and The Kim (lox) and loved them. My husband isn't picky, but he went to school for culinary arts (non-practincing lol) and can tell when businesses cut corners in food and it's pretty disappointing most of the time. Fresh Thymes is AWESOME and we can't wait to try more of the menu for breakfast and lunch. Take the time to visit this spot!

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Aspect Category Reconciliation:**
   - There is agreement across the agents that ""cheesesteak"" is the aspect term categorized under ""food quality"". For the other aspect, all agents agree on ""hours"" with the category ""restaurant miscellaneous"".

2. **Opinion Term Consensus:**
   - The consistent opinion terms identified for ""cheesesteak"" by Agents 1 and 2 are ""love"", ""super delish"", and ""wayyyy better"". These terms effectively capture both sentences' sentiment towards the cheesesteak.
   - For ""hours"", the opinion term ""HORRIBLE"" was unanimously agreed upon by all agents.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Reconciliation:**
   - The sentiment for ""cheesesteak"" was unanimously positive across all agents, with two agents assigning an intensity score of 5. Considering the intensity of the positive terms, a score of 5 reflects the strong positive sentiment accurately.
   - The sentiment for ""hours"" was consistently negative. Agents 1 and 2 opted for intensity scores of -5 and -4, respectively, suggesting strong negativity. Given the manual emphasis in the text (""HORRIBLE hours!""), a score of -5 is warranted.

The final reconciled output effectively integrates the strongest consensus points of the provided analyses."

**Explanation:**
- **Group 1:** The aspect term was consolidated to ""restaurant"" since LLM Agent 3 used a more comprehensive term, and the category was agreed upon as ""restaurant general"" due to two agents using this category. The intensity scored reached consensus at 5 as it was given by two agents, and the opinion term maintained the punctuation as noted by LLM Agent 2.
- **Group 2:** The aspect term ""food"" was universally agreed upon, and the category was consistently ""food quality"" across all agents. The sentiment intensity score was averaged to 4 for the final output, which two agents also reported, while the opinion terms reflected the consistent wording used by agents, preserving original punctuation and casing."

Get the Brie-stuffed French Toast w/ Apricot Glaze and a coffee, and sit on the patio when it's nice out - you will not regret it!!!! I branch out sometimes but always return to the Brie French Toast. Top 3 Favorite brunch item in the city I've tried. I still consider myself a regular here even though it's been months. Friendly staff, always great service, cash only but the ATM on-site won't derail your brunching. Small space gets crowded sometimes but they're never too overwhelmed to take care of you. Love to see they opened a second location and seem to be doing well! Now I'm hungry and think I'll stop by in the snow today.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

Also, kind of random but their playlist is *insert multiple fire emojis*, it's also the chefs playlist! My friends and I are pretty much regulars here and they definitely provide the best service compared to the other KBBQ place in town, and even when ordering wayyyy too much food, they always get it right. You're also able to order boba from the Asian express side, and they have a pretty impressive wine list. The Hawaiian steak, chardol, any of the pork bellies, and kimchi tofu soup are my go to staples.","```json

### Consolidation:

- **Group 1**: The aspect term ""restaurant"" was supported by Agents 1 and 2 along with ""place"" recognizing the overall sentiment towards the location. Since the sentiment and opinion term align with both ""Loooove"" and ""love everything,"" and the intensity at 5 from agents, it merges into one thought focusing on the restaurant overall, categorizing it under 'restaurant general'.

- **Group 2**: The agreement across all agents about ""pasta"" being ""the best!!"" as 'food quality' with a sentiment intensity score of 5 indicates a consensus, thus confirming this aspect conclusion.

- **Group 3**: There is alignment across all agents regarding ""Salad"" being ""excellent"" pertaining to 'food quality', with a consistent sentiment intensity score of 4. This serves to confirm this aspect conclusion with confidence from all analyses."
200,"This is our absolute favorite spot on the Hill, I have no idea how I haven't written a review before now! We jokingly call it our ""Applebees"" because it's our local spot that we can always agree on and never disappoints. Their pastas are amazing (try the pink sauce!), they have two of my favorite salads in the city (the kale caesar and the house), and all their appetizers are sooo good. Some nights we just do appetizers, which usually consists of t-ravs, baked goat cheese and spanakopita, though sometimes we mix it up. They also have the nicest servers ever!! Seriously, these girls rock. 

Since COVID, we have only been doing takeout and have consistently had really great food every time (and we eat here at least once a month, if not more). They do offer curbside, but since dine-in has reopened and the Hill has gotten busier, it's easier to just run in and get our food. They are offering indoor dining and have adjusted the dining room to fit restrictions, but we aren't comfortable eating inside anyplace, so it's nice that we always know we're getting good food when we order takeout from here.","```json

### Explanation:
The final conclusions merged the analyses of all three agents with the following reconciliations:

1. **Service General (Group 1):** 
   - All three agents agree on the aspect category (""service general""), polarity (""positive""), and high sentiment intensity score (""5""). The specific terminology used for the aspect (""service"" and ""waiter service"") was unified as ""service.""

2. **Food Quality - Seasonal Burger (Group 2):**
   - All agents were in agreement about the aspect term (""seasonal burger with bacon jam""), the positive sentiment (""positive""), and the intensity score (""5"").

3. **Food Quality - Wings (Group 3):**
   - The sentiment towards the wings was reconciled to ""mixed,"" reflecting both positive (flavor) and negative (chewy/dry texture) opinions. The intensity score was set at -1 to reflect this mixed reception, suggesting minor negative sentiment towards cooking quality rather than overwhelming displeasure.
   
4. **Restaurant General (Group 4):**
   - The term ""restaurant"" was chosen to encompass the general impression (connotation similar to ""place"") as noted in agent analyses. The sentiment was positive, with an intensity of ""4"", indicating strong approval with intention to return. 

This consolidates the evaluations into a coherent ABSA result consistent with agent analyses."

**Final Conclusion:**

- **Mexican food** is a widely recognized aspect in the text. LLM Agents 1 and 2 agree on a strong positive sentiment with high intensity, and Agent 3 acknowledges similarly with a slightly different intensity score. Acknowledging the frequent reference to pricing, a category of **food general** was chosen to align with the majority and maintain consistency in sentiment.
  
- **Tacos and appetizers** are collectively appreciated as per all agents. There's agreement on the positive sentiment with a consensus on the intensity score. LLM Agent 2 divided the aspect but combining them fits best.

- **Menu items with pineapple** is an aspect derived consistently from the text. Agents agree on positive sentiment, but intensity by Agent 3 was slightly lower. Averaging with stronger agent perspectives ensures coherence.
  
- **Pico** has a positive sentiment recognized by all. While there’s a content addition by Agent 3 mentioning **takeout food**, it directly stems from the enjoyment of **pico**, thus reflecting its role as a prominent contributing factor rather than a separate aspect.

This distilled integration conveys the customer’s sentiments accurately and accounts for each aspect with consolidated data from provided outputs."

226,Great coffee. One of the best iced americanos in Nashville...but the service is sooooooooo slow. If you put an order in online they don't make it until you get there. ??? What's the point of that? That's pretty lame. Also if you order anything with cream a sweetener they tell you to just add it yourself even when you order a drink that way. If you have to be anywhere on time this is not your place. If you have 25 minutes (I'm not exaggerating) to wait for your coffee you'll be fine.,"Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

### Explanation:
- **Coffee**: All agents agree on the positive sentiment and high intensity for ""coffee"" based on ""Great"" and ""best,"" hence, we consolidated as a positive sentiment under ""drinks quality"".
- **Iced Americano**: A specific mention was identified as positive with high intensity, categorized under ""drinks quality.""
- **Service**: Consistency across agents regarding the negative sentiment due to ""sooooooooo slow,"" ""not your place,"" and ""25 minutes"" concerning the slow service and waiting time, with the highest negativity score.
- **Online Order**: Recognized negatively by all showing inconvenience with an ""online order,"" marked under ""service general"" based on opinions like ""pretty lame.""
- **Cream and Sweetener**: All agents note the neutral sentiment pertaining to the style options where customers add their desired ingredients themselves, thus remaining neutral under ""drinks style_options."""

**Explanation:**

1. **Service Aspect (service general):** All agents agreed the service was excellent. Given the consensus from Agent 2 and 3 and the sentiment intensity of 5, it is appropriate to mark this as a positive sentiment with a strong intensity score of 5.

2. **Food Quality Aspect (food quality):** All agents mentioned the quick arrival and quality of the food. The combination of speed and quality comments results in a strong positive opinion about the food, akin to a 5 intensity score as evidenced by all agent insights. The aspect category fits best under food quality.

3. **Restaurant Aspect (restaurant general):** The discussion about the overall experience suggests a strong positive sentiment related to the restaurant being a 'new favorite', the desire to return, and giving it 'five stars'. We synthesized the common aspects from all agents resulting in a conclusive strong positive sentiment of intensity 5 in this category."

**Explanation:**  
- The sentiment toward ""price"" as being ""upfront"" was agreed to be neutral, as both positive and negative classifications appeared, opting for neutrality reflects the final decision based on Agent 1's analysis, which seemed more fitting and balanced given the discrepancies noted later.
- The ""pricing discrepancy"" aspect is retained from Agent 1 and Agent 3, showing a clear negative sentiment with strong evidence from all agents; thus, the intensity remains at -3 based on agreement in sentiment.
- The ""cashier"" aspect retains its neutrality, consistent across agents 1 and 3, as the focus was more on the ""tax"" explanation and did not invoke negative sentiment.
- The sentiment regarding ""pricing honesty"" maintains strong negativity due to its consistent appearance across all analyses, with a verifiable intensity of -4 reflecting the strong dissatisfaction with dishonesty as captured by all agents.
- Finally, ""customer experience"" and ""warning"" aspects aligned, with sentiment intensity as -2 indicating a cautionary note without dramatic opposition."

**Rationale:**
1. **Aspect Term:** For the aspect term referring to the overall place, there is consensus between agents 1 and 3 on using ""restaurant"" with the higher sentiment intensity. In terms of ""drunken shrimp,"" all agents agree on this aspect term.
2. **Aspect Category:** The category chosen for the general evaluation of the place is ""restaurant general,"" which was suggested by agents 1 and 3 as ""location general"" might imply a solely geographic context. For ""drunken shrimp,"" we consolidated towards ""food quality,"" aligning with agent 1 and 3’s use of specific terms like ""delicious sauce"" which implies food quality.
3. **Opinion Term and Sentiment Intensity Score:** For the restaurant, the term ""hidden gem!!!"" is consistent with ""must try"" in all agents' outputs, aligning with the most positive sentiment intensity of 5. For the aspect of ""drunken shrimp,"" the combined sentiment considers the intensity scores across agents, settling on the predominantly positive opinions with intensity 4 reflecting its strong recommendation, especially given specific compliments about flavor."

I'm not sure what the difference between a Brooklyn style pizza and Sicilian but regardless I was happy to have so many options. Under specialty pizzas they had everything from vegetable lovers, bacon chicken ranch, taco, even a chicken fajita pizza! These people are awesome!!! 

I went with the bruschetta pizza and it was delicious! Their white pizza has just enough garlic topped with fresh tomatoes and Basil! I can't wait to be back in the area to try more pies! Yum!","[

**Explanation:**

The reconciled conclusion integrates consistent elements across the agents' responses as follows:

1. **Group 1** for ""bubble tea"" incorporates the aggregate opinion terms ""wayyy too sweet"" and ""undrinkable"" from each agent, with a strong negative sentiment and intensity score of -4, which aligns with all agents' classification of the primary criticism of over-sweetness.
   
2. **Group 2** highlights the explicit action ""threw it away"" as a separate notable sentiment, acknowledging the significant negative feedback of discarding the drink after a few sips. This reflects a sentiment intensity of -3, balancing between agents' varied intensity scores.

3. **Group 3** on ""boba"" focuses on the descriptive term ""Hard"", harmonizing the sentiment intensity between -2 and -3 given its consistent negative interpretation.

These steps ensure the conclusion captures nuanced sentiment variations while addressing definitive aspects and opinions expressed in the original document."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect ""Waiter"":** All agents agree that the waiter was a significant focus of the text, combining multiple opinions such as ""amazing,"" ""so kind,"" ""helpful,"" ""fixed it right away,"" and ""sooo well."" The sentiment is universally positive with a high intensity score supported by all agents.

2. **Aspect ""Food"":** While Agent 2 highlights ""price"" as a distinct aspect, aspects concerning ""food"" and its quality are consistently recognized by all agents, particularly its perfection and good price (""not so spendy""). Therefore, categorizing it under ""food quality"" with a high intensity score acknowledges the overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the food's quality and pricing.

3. **Aspect ""Deal"":** There is a consensus about the value aspect, referring to the free queso and chips, which is perceived positively in terms of ""such a deal"" and ""get your moneys worth."" This aspect combines insights from Agents 1 and 2 and resolves under the category of ""restaurant prices"" with a slightly lower intensity score to account for varying opinions across agents."

295,"Simply put, it's our favorite place to have beignets and coffee in all of New Orleans. FAR BETTER than Cafe du Monde in every way! Great service (especially the nice kid with floppy hair, he's super sweet!), amazing beignets, great coffee, very reasonable prices, and wonderful ambiance both inside with acoustic guitar in the evenings or outside on the gorgeous, shaded private patio. With street performers on the other side of the patio's wrought iron fence, it allows you to see and hear everything well but the fence assures you aren't heckled for money and don't need to worry too much about safety. We make it a point to go there several times each trip because it's just that wonderful! Already can't wait to go back!!!  :-)","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

**Consolidated Conclusion:**

1. **Food Quality:** The consensus across the agents is that the food, including the roasted oysters, was overall rated positively, with some minor mixed opinions due to the size of one oyster. The sentiment is strong positive, reflected by a sentiment intensity score of 4 for aspects of ""Great food"", ""Loved"", ""First class"", and ""just as good.""

2. **Service General:** The service, particularly highlighted by Kristin's performance as a waitress, is unanimously seen as positive, with opinions like ""good service"" and ""upbeat and helpful."" Accordingly, a sentiment intensity score of 2 is appropriate for service, while a 3 reflects specific commendation towards the waitress.

### Explanation:
1. **Aspect Term ""BBQ place""**:
   - Consensus on aspect term as ""BBQ place"" with ""new favorite"" and ""go-to"" as positive opinions.
   - Chose ""restaurant general"" as the category since two out of three agents classified it as such.

2. **Aspect Term ""food""**:
   - Agreement among agents on terms like ""amazing"" and ""scrumptious"" forming part of the opinion.
   - Food-related category and strong positive sentiment were consistent, with ""food quality"" being most appropriate based on majority and strongest culinary descriptor.

3. **Aspect Term ""server""**:
   - Full agreement on the sentiment and category with description ""wonderful!!!!"" being highly positive.
   
4. **Aspect Term ""parking""**:
   - All agents recognized mixed sentiments about parking.
   - Most accurate category was ""location general,"" indicating a general location-based challenge, with mixed/neutral sentiment prevalent. The intensity reflects a slight positive despite the challenge, acknowledging ""worth the walk"" as an opinion term."

```

**Consolidated Reasoning:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category:**
   - For the service aspect, all agents agree on the term ""Samantha"" or ""server Samantha"" being linked to the ""service general"" category.
   - For the location aspect, the term ""dicks"" is recognized by all agents, and there's agreement on the category being ""location general"" for the neutral sentiment.

2. **Opinion Term:**
   - The opinion terms for ""Samantha"" are consistently highlighted as ""awesome awesome!!!!!"" and ""the best!!!"" by at least two of the agents, confirming these as the definitive opinion terms.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:**
   - All agents agree on the positive sentiment associated with Samantha, assigning the highest intensity score of 5.
   - There's some variance in the opinion regarding ""dicks"" and its sentiment. Agent 1 and 3 suggest a neutral sentiment with a score of 0, while Agent 2 indicates a slight negative sentiment with more opinion context. However, the dominant conclusion from Agents 1 and 3 supports a neutral sentiment, which is thus adopted in the final conclusion.

This deliberate review of the agents' outputs ensures the consolidated result aligns with the most consistent analyses across the agents while maintaining adherence to the task instructions."

320,"Excellent seafood.  They are very particular as to what is sold out of their market.  Also, they are honest as to how fresh the fish is.  We go there just to buy tuna and salmon for sushi/poke and I have been told on occasion that the fish was not to be used raw which meant I didn't buy it on those couple occasions.  Lost a sale, but gained a loyal, long term customer. 

  You too can make sushi at home!  It's waaayyyy less expensive than eating out and, honestly, the fish from Trader Bay is of better quality than any of our local sushi restaurants. Ask for sushi quality tuna and fresh Scottish salmon (Thursday afternoon is the best time to go!)

322,Worst experience and food! We had tried this place in February and it was great the food was fast and service was friendly! Today food took 55 minutes and my eggs died in the lights waiting for my husbands eggs Benedict . We never got silverware and our waitress kept leaving the room not sure why? We asked for ketchup 2x and my husbands potatoes were cold anyway. It seems the place was heading the right way a few months ago but now has gone back to why we stopped coming here. We bought 2 deals and will be requesting a refund it's really a shame it can be such a cute place.it appears they put all their $ into the other 2 places and this one suffers not sure what deal is?????

### Consolidation Explanation:
1. **Aspect Term and Sentences:**
   - All agents agree on the aspect terms used across respective sentences and correctly extracted aspect terms are kept in the final output.

2. **Categories:**
   - For ""gooey butter cake shake"", agent 1 and agent 2 identify 'drinks quality', while agent 3 offers 'drinks style_options'. Majority agrees on 'drinks quality', thus 'drinks quality' is chosen.
   - For ""atmosphere"", all agree on 'ambience general'.
   - For ""shop"", agents differ between 'restaurant general' by agent 1, 'location general' by agent 3. The deciding factor is that 'everything about the shop' aligns more with 'restaurant general' as it deals more broadly with the shop experience rather than its location.

3. **Opinion Term:**

   - For ""gooey butter cake shake"", the consensus in intensity suggests a score of 5 due to agent 1 and agent 3 assigning a 5, suggesting strong positivity.

As we were waiting to get our table, he brought us our screwdrivers and just added them on our bill when we sat down.

We came for brunch on a gorgeous patio-worthy day, and we were happy to find a good sized patio! If it's not a patio day, the inside is so cool with all of these antique items on the shelves and gosh it smells good in there. Our cashier was helpful and the definition of hospitality. We decided on the biscuits & gravy and the blueberry pancakes with lemon curd, a special that day. Both were great! I also got a cold brew coffee which was sooo good and my husband got a mimosa, and I think that was the best thing we got! They fresh squeeze their orange juice, and you can tell.

368,"I LOVE this place! I came here once to switch up my normal Starbucks study sessions, and try somewhere new...needless to say, I've been back several times since!

The inside is so spacious and welcoming, the wifi is free? the owners and their staff are extremely friendly and helpful, and their dessert selection is not only impressive, but from what I've tried so far, they're also very well made! I get the Café Bombón to drink (half espresso shots, half sweetened condensed milk), and it is the most perfect, sweet, creamy pick-me-up you could ask for! For dessert, I've tried their banana pudding (to DIE for), their Chocolate Pot du Jour (a luxuriously smooth dark chocolate/espresso custard), and the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cream Pie (again, another winner!)

I sooooo recommend this place! I live in Tampa, but am slowly becoming a regular at this St. Pete staple!","[

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term ""thai food""**: All agents identified ""thai food"" with the opinion terms being ""Yummmmmm"" and ""best"", consistently labeling it with a positive polarity and a sentiment intensity score of 5. I followed the majority of the agents in excluding ""!!"" as an opinion term.

2. **Aspect Term ""basil fried rice""**: All agents recognized ""basil fried rice"" with the opinion term ""awesome"". The intensity score varied, with two agents marking it as 4, but I leaned towards an intensity score of 5, considering the strongly positive sentiment generally expressed in the document.

3. **Aspect Term ""pad thai""**: Similar to ""basil fried rice"", it was identified with the opinion term ""awesome"". Although the intensity score varied, I concluded a score of 5, aligning with the strong positive sentiment from multiple agents and the overall context of the text."

i came in for lunch and we waited about 5 minutes for a host to come up but it wasn't busy at all, i guess they just didn't have a lot of workers that day. i could tell by the few tables that were occupied that they were also waiting for their waiters

once we got seated i ordered the french onion soup, a breakfast sandwich w/ porkroll. my friend got sweet potato fries and the duck quesadilla

french onion soup - cheese was good but the soup itself was suuuper bland. not worth it for the price, i've had much better

breakfast sandwich w/ porkroll - this was so so, not worth it for the price again. i can get it for $5 at the deli near my apartment for better quality. the egg was not well cooked and the bread was stale. the breakfast potatoes were also bland and not warm

the sweet potato fries were probably the most decent thing i ate here. the service was mediocre and the restaurant itself was pretty small and empty, something needs to happen!","```json

391,"Honestly this is the best asian food in Reno.  I was born and raised in Hawaii (the asian mixing bowl of the pacific) and been all over Asian in my travels and I have to say that Pho Mein has really hit it on the head for great tasting and authentic asian food!  The Vietnamese and Chinese dishes are perfect, fast, hot, and taste rediculously good (better than the holes in the wall in Hawaii too!).

I HIGHLY recommend this place to anyone coming to Reno and in the need for asian food.  The noodles are awesome and the duck in superb, the broth and the light sauces are fantastic!  Im sooooo glad I found this place in Reno (which is definitely not known for its asian fare).  It looks very ""typically"" mainland interpretation of an asian restaurant, which is why I didn't want to eat there for a long time, but I just happened to be there and be hungry one night and it changed my eating schedule permanently!

I eat there often now and have yet to have a bad/slow/bland meal, and the service is phenomenal and the prices are very reasonable.","[

394,"I've been here multiple times for sushi burritos, and it doesn't get old. I love sushi in general, and will take it in any available form. While it doesn't come with a whole lot of meat/fish/protein option, there is an option to upgrade and pay a little more to get a little more. Honestly, the rice makes it pretty filling either way, so if you're trying to save your pennies, just forego the upgrade. They have pre-set options for burritos, or you can build your own.

I do recommend getting the Iced Matcha Green Tea, its lightly sweetened, and sooo good - even if you're not a huge fan of matcha.

I usually order the Chicago dog or just the LOADED Tots, but because I was headed to a winetasting at 1 o'clock in the afternoon, I went for the MAXWELL STREET POLISH and an order of fries/tots. One bite into the polish transformed me to Chicago's Maxwell Street!! My goodness it was JUST LIKE THE MEMORIES of going there with my family as a child!! The caramelized onions and peppers topped the polish on the somewhat soggy, sesame seed bun was sooo delicious!

**Consolidation Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term:** 
   - The aspect term was uniformly related across the analyses, ranging from ""check-in line"" to ""check-in process"", to ""checking in"". Given that all refer to the same operation at a location, ""check-in process"" was selected as a clear representation.

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - While the majority classified the category as ""service general"", there was a deviation with ""restaurant miscellaneous"" from Agent 3. Considering the context and predominant agent output focusing on service delivery, ""service general"" was determined as the appropriate category.

3. **Opinion Term:**
   - Opinion terms ""horrible!!!!!!!!"", ""so long"" (consolidated to ""always so long"" for specificity), ""need more"", and ""30 people!!!!!"" were aligned across reports. Each reflects a negative sentiment against the service aspect.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:**
   - All findings identified the sentiment as negative, with intensity scores largely showcasing high negativity. Negative sentiment was consistent at the peak, with a score of -5, reflecting the extremely negative sentiment intensity expressed by the input text.

This consolidated output integrates the consensus from all agent outputs, preserving consensus details and reflecting a robust negative sentiment about the check-in experience."

**Final Conclusion:**

The conclusion reconciles the outputs of the three LLM agents. Agent 1 identified two different sentiments on different aspects of bacon wrapped crab stuffed prawns: a neutral sentiment with regard to its style and a positive sentiment with regard to its quality. Agents 2 and 3 aligned with Agent 1's positive sentiment towards quality but combined both sentences into a single analysis. The final output preserves Agent 1's nuanced distinction between the two aspects, recognizing both the style and the quality aspects, with appropriate sentiment and intensity scores for each."

424,"If ever you've been confused by a review of mine where I gave a popular restaurant with high ratings a low star review... then come to Tito's and see why!!!

So far I've only tried the CHURRASCO SKIRT STEAK PLATE ($14) with yellow rice, but I honestly don't know if I will ever try anything else because it was SOOOO GOOD! Seasoned by angels and cooked with such perfection that I will absolutely crave this for the rest of my life! THIS, my dear Yelp people, is EXACTLY what I mean by ""flavorful"" seasoning. They have completely ruined skirt steak cooked by anyone else because I can't go back to anything less than this level of satisfaction! Even the Strawberry Banana Smoothie ($6) is excellent!

Tito's is currently located in an empty lot next to the Citgo Gas Station on the corner of North Jones Ave and West Waters Street, but this is also the location of their soon to be brick & mortar restaurant. So if you love New York style Puerto Rican cuisine, rush here as soon as possible and taste heaven on a plate!

**Explanation:**

1. **Beer Selection:** All agents identified this aspect with a consistent positive sentiment and an intensity score of 4, except Agent 3 which gave a score of 2. The stronger consensus score of 4 is adopted.

2. **Restaurant Identity:** All agents discussed the identity and place sentiment with negative polarity. The sentiment intensity was slightly debated (-2 vs -3), but the majority leaned more negative, thus adopting -3 in the ""restaurant general"" category.

3. **Pulled Pork Nachos:** This aspect had consistent negative feedback across all agents, with varying intensity (-3 to -5). The consensus choice here is -4 due to the strong negative terms ""huge slab,"" ""unrendered fat,"" and ""Yuck,"" aligning it to an overall strong negative sentiment.

4. **Noise Level:** The sentiment is consistently negative across the agents, with most intensity scores clustering around -2 or -3, deemed moderate negative.

5. **Waitress:** All agents identified ""attentive"" as positive, with slight variance in intensity between scores of 2. The consistently derived intensity is 2, denoting a moderate positive sentiment."

I was basically dismissed by the woman who answered the phone who at first told me they weren't logged on to Grubhub, then told me my food was about to go out, then blamed Grubhub.   Not feeling confident in her answer I called GrubHub who told me they would check on the order.   GrubHub called me back and told me that they were also nasty to him, but told him the order was out for delivery.   I asked GrubHub to cancel my order, which they did.   Two hours after I placed my order (and after I had successfully gotten food from somewhere else) they brought the food to my house and didn't even try to apologize.  I sent the food back.  This restaurant clearly lied time and time again.

**Conclusion**:

1. **Delivery Time**: The delivery time was significantly delayed, with the sentiment being negative due to actual delivery far exceeding the promised timeframe. The intensity score reflects a moderate level of dissatisfaction.

2. **Communication**: There was poor communication as the restaurant staff was dismissive and inconsistent. The sentiment is notably negative given multiple complaints in this area, with a strong dissatisfaction rating.

3. **Order Cancellation**: The order was successfully canceled by GrubHub at the request of the customer. This interaction is neutral due to the process occurring as expected without additional issues.

4. **Delivery Service**: The late delivery, coupled with a lack of apology, contributed to a negative sentiment. The level of dissatisfaction is intense because of the compounded issues.

5. **Honesty**: The perception of dishonesty is the most critical negative aspect highlighted, with both explicit warnings against using the service and accusations of lying, which underscore extreme dissatisfaction."

### Rationale:
1. **Fried Chicken**: All three agents recognized ""fried chicken"" as an aspect term relating to food quality with highly positive opinions and consistently a sentiment intensity score of 5. The aspect, opinion terms, category, and sentiment were unanimously agreed upon as positive, reflecting the robustness of this analysis across all agents.

2. **Daiquiri**: The aspect term ""daiquiri"" was identified by all agents within the context of drinks style_options. The key difference among the agents was the sentiment polarity and the opinion term. Agent 3 identified a positive sentiment with an intensity of 2 and cited ""to enjoy"" as an opinion term, which seems appropriate considering the context that highlights enjoyment. While Agents 1 and 2 saw it as neutral, Agent 3's inclusion of ""to enjoy"" supports a slight positive sentiment reflecting a favorable experience. The conclusion opts to highlight this sentiment as positive, aligning more with a customer perspective of enjoyment reflected in the narrative."

```

### Explanation:

- **Group 1 Conclusion**: All agents agree on the sentiment and category for ""bridge benedict"". The majority consensus among opinions is maintained.

- **Group 2 Clarification**: There was a split between ""food quality"" and ""food style_options"" for the category. Given that the sentence discusses the style, not just quality, settling on ""food style_options"" provides a more accurate representation. The additional opinion term ""more like a dissert"" from Agent 2 is included for a comprehensive capture of sentiment nuances, as it better accounts for varied opinions expressed about the 'french toast'. The sentiment polarity and intensity scores are agreed upon across agents and hence remain consistent."

**Explanation:**
- **Aspect Term & Sentiment Polarity:** Majority consensus was used for both aspect terms and sentiment polarities. Disagreements were resolved by selecting the most frequently associated aspect term and its corresponding sentiment.
- **Sentiment Intensity Score:** Where scores differed, a consensus or average was considered, with emphasis on maintaining strong consistency wherever clear extremes were presented.
- **Category:** Given the varied categorization across agents especially for expressions like ""experience"" and ""family trip"", the most contextually appropriate category based on majority and original context was chosen.
- **Note:** Minor variations in expression handling were normalized for consistency, such as certain phrasing in opinion terms."

**Consolidation Notes:**

- **Aspect Term & Category:** Some discrepancies in aspect categories were observed (e.g., fish tank was categorized as 'restaurant miscellaneous' and 'ambience general'). The category 'ambience general' was chosen as it aligns with the broad sentiment about the environment.
  
- **Opinion Term & Sentiment Polarity:** Variations in opinion terms across agents (e.g., 'is cool' vs 'cool') have been reconciled for clarity and adherence to opinion extraction guidelines. Consistent positive sentiments were noted across aspects, significant agreements were achieved especially for terms like 'fantastic', 'AMAZING', and '110% satisfied', resulting in strong positive polarity.
  
- **Sentiment Intensity Score:** Score harmonization considered the majority member opinion; divergences such as intensity on 'Jenn' were aligned to reflect the high sentiment collectively observed by all agents. Disagreement on the 'service' aspect regarding the drink order resulted in a negative score based on a negative experience outlined consistently across analyses."

### Explanation:
1. **breakfast burrito**: All agents recognized the positive sentiment towards the breakfast burrito with high intensity, and agreed on categorizing it under 'food quality'.

2. **tortilla chips**: Despite slight variations in spelling and scoring, they agreed on a negative sentiment towards tortilla chips. Categorized as 'food quality', with Agent 2's suggestion of 'food prices' considered but outweighed by majority choice.

3. **other food**: Positive sentiment was consistent across agents, recognizing the phrase 'pretty good'. The category 'food general' was balanced across the analyses, with appropriate sentiment intensity.

4. **portions**: There is consensus on considering the term 'portions' with the effect of fullness as neutral. The 'restaurant general' category was chosen, focusing the sentiment on the logistical aspect of serving sizes/fill rather than food quality per se."

**Consolidation Reasoning**:

1. **Group 1**: All agents consistently identified the aspect term as ""hostess"" and found strong negative sentiment related to the refusal to seat the customer. The sentiment intensity score was generally agreed upon at -4, reflective of strong dissatisfaction with the service.

2. **Group 2**: The aspect term ""reservation"" was uniformly identified by agents, with a strong negative sentiment concerning the cancellation of the reservation despite acknowledgment of a pre-existing reservation. Agent 1 and 2 scored this at -5 and -4 respectively, while Agent 3 scored it at -3. A score of -4 is chosen as it effectively balances the results, acknowledging strong negativity.

3. **Group 3**: All agents recognized ""service"" as the aspect term, with consensus on extreme dissatisfaction expressed through terms like ""Ridiculous"", ""subpar"", and ""Won't be back"". The sentiment intensity score varied slightly, but the predominant strong negative score was -5, capturing the intensity of the disappointment."

```

**Conclusion:**

- **Sushi:** All agents agree on the positive sentiment towards the sushi, emphasizing ""Great"", ""taste amazing..."", and ""the best"". There is consensus on the category ""food quality"" and a high sentiment intensity of 5.

- **Happy Hour:** Agents initially differ on the category assignment, with one suggesting ""drinks style_options"" and another ""restaurant miscellaneous"". However, since the sentence ""love the happy hour"" directly pertains to drinks, ""drinks style_options"" seems most fitting. The positive sentiment is consistently emphasized with ""love"", and the sentiment intensity score is averaged at 4.

- **Drinks:** There is a uniform agreement across all agents about the positive sentiment concerning drinks, described as ""awesome!!"". The category ""drinks quality"" and a strong sentiment intensity score of 5 are consistent among results.

- **Place:** The sentiment towards ""place"" shows some variation. Initially neutral in one result and negative in others, with ""needs some upgrades"" cited as the opinion term. Considering the verbiage used suggests an improvement needed, a negative sentiment seems more appropriate with an averaged intensity score of -2 and ""ambience general"" as the most fitting category."

**Explanation for Consolidation:**
1. **Experience**: All agents identified a positive sentiment towards the ""experience"", with high intensity. The intensity score has been rounded to 5 as it aligns more with the excitement expressed in ""not disappointed!!!!"".

2. **Pizza**: The agreement on both sentiment polarity (positive) and opinion term (""awesome"") justified the selection of the intensity score of 5 due to its consistent excellence emphasis by all agents.

3. **Chicken Marco**: Given consistent recognition across reports for being ""a delight"" and categorized under ""food quality”, the most appropriate intensity score is aligned with agents 1 and 3’s assessment of 3.

4. **Waitstaff/Customer Service**: All agents acknowledged a positive sentiment regarding waitstaff but had slight variances in terms. Given an overall strong impression from customer service, the sentiment has been confirmed as positive with a consistent score of 3."

I tried the California shrimp tempura roll and it was soooo good. I was expecting a small roll but it was big compared to other places I've gone. My husband got the ca roll and teriyaki bowl special and that was a deal for the price. The workers were friendly and the place was clean. Will definately be back again when in the area.,"```json

It's the real deal - if you like Domino's, you will not like it.  If you like Pizza Hut, you will not like it. If you like Ledo's, you got it - you won't like it.

The pizza is made the Italian way - not the American way. Crust is super thin and just the right amount of sauce and cheese.

Staff was great - friendly, and even showed us their pizza oven - they had artisans come from Italy to create and even had the stones shipped in from Italy to build it.

**Explanation:**

1. **Wait at Warrington** was consistently identified as having a sentiment of ""negative"" due to the long wait, with both agents 1 and 2 reporting a sentiment intensity score of -2, aligning well with the overall sentiment tone of inconvenience expressed.

2. **Cleanliness at the north Wales location** was universally recognized as a negative aspect, described as ""filthy"", with a consensus for the sentiment intensity leaning towards -5. While individual attributes like floors, tables, and chairs were addressed separately by two agents, consolidating them under ""cleanliness"" offers a clearer, comprehensive view of the hygiene issues.

3. **Staff and Manager** received uniformly positive sentiment across all agents, though with variation in intensity scores. A consensus emerges around a positive sentiment, reflected in the final balanced score of 3. Despite slight discrepancies in intensity ratings among agents, the distinction of positive feedback on service is undeniable."

The menu isn't really special (copied Peg's a little) but what this place does good is basic breakfast, customer service and the pricing is awesome. The owners used to run Sushi Club wayyyyyyy back in the days but now they focus on breakfast and that's good. They are friendly people and it shows in their new adventure.","[

**Consolidation Explanation:**
1. **For ""cochon breakfast biscuit"":** All agents identified ""cochon breakfast biscuit"" as the aspect term within the sentences, with the sentiment being consistently positive and the intensity score being a strong positive across all agents. Hence, the consensus leads us to conclude the same.

2. **For ""wait"":** While the sentiment classification remained positive across the board, there was variance in the intensity score: 2 from Agents 1 and 2 and 4 from Agent 3. A moderate reconciliation to 3 reflects slight amplification given the recognition of higher intensity by an agent.

3. **For ""rating"":** Recognized only by Agent 3 with a strong positive sentiment, this was incorporated as it reflects an overarching sentiment regarding the restaurant's experience.

In each case, the phrasing of the opinion terms was consolidated to capture the range of expressions used in the document."

**Consolidation Rationale:**

1. **Experience**: Added based on Agent 3's unique identification of the overall experience, scoring a moderate positive sentiment intensity of 4.

2. **Cooks**: All agents agree on ""cooks"" being positively described as ""sooooo friendly"" and ""fun"", with Agents 1 and 3 assigning the highest intensity of 5. 

3. **Cooking Performance**: Recognized from Agent 2, the performance aspect (""do tricks"") is valid and distinct from general friendliness and thus retained. 

4. **Salad Dressing**: Consensus across agents on a highly positive opinion (""VERY good""), maintaining the strongest sentiment intensity of 5 from Agents 1 and 2.

5. **Chicken Teriyaki**: Consistent opinion of it being ""always great,"" with agreement on sentiment being positive with moderate intensity.

6. **Price**: While opinions varied in categorization, coherently merged to focus on the statement about meal price (""each meal is about $18""), maintaining a neutral sentiment reflecting factual nature and categorized under ""restaurant prices""."

### Explanation:

1. The ""Philly cheesesteak"" was initially tagged as both positive and neutral regarding the term ""famous."" For consistency, considering its context and the majority consensus, it is set to neutral in the ""food general"" category.

2. The ""meat"" and ""bread"" consistently received negative evaluations due to being ""tasteless"" and ""soggy,"" respectively, with minor variance in intensity scores. We adopt the most common strong indication of dissatisfaction (-3) in the ""food quality"" category.

3. The expectation of ""juicy"" steak was uniformly positive, while everyone agreed the actual experience was poor. Therefore, it holds a moderate positive sentiment in ""food quality.""

4. The reference to ""Hooters"" carries a positive sentiment showing a preference over the current location, with consistent categorization and scores across agents.

5. ""Experience"" was varied but overwhelmingly negative. Harmonizing this based on agent outputs, the sentiment intensity is -5, tied to ""restaurant miscellaneous.""

6. ""Geno's"" was consistently negative, noted for a disappointing experience, with agreed sentiment scores and categorization.

By integrating the results, the analysis provides the most agreed-upon and coherent sentiment overview, ensuring alignment and agreement on both opinion terms and categorization."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term ""food"":**  
   All agents agreed on the term ""food"" associated with highly positive sentiment based on the opinions ""always amazing"" and ""never disappoints!!!!"" consistently. Thus, the sentiment polarity is ""positive"" with an intensity score of ""5"", indicating strong positive sentiment in the food quality category.

2. **Aspect Term ""rooftop view seat"":**  
   There were some differences regarding both the term and category; however, common agreement and review of the context leads to maintaining ""rooftop view seat"" with a neutral opinion indicator (""!!!!""). The sentiment polarity is classified as ""neutral"" with an intensity score of ""0"", and it falls under the ""ambience general"" category as majority agreed. This aligns with the minor sentiment expression in the text regarding the seating preference."

583,"Just had an awesome family dinner here. For a pretty small place, they were super accommodating of our large party (we had two full tables). The staff was pretty patient with our big groups; some of them were more friendly than others, but nothing negative enough to affect the night. The food was absolutely delicious. We got tons of appetizers and everyone was really happy with their meals. Best apps we got were definitely the calamari and the caprese. The chicken parm was really good, and whatever the special was (spaghetti with seafood and blush sauce) was sooo good. My favorite part, though, was the limoncello sorbet at dessert!!","Final consolidated ABSA result:

### Reconciliation:
1. **Aspect Term for Group 1:**  
   All agents recognized the sentiment as directed towards food, either explicitly towards ""tacos"" or ""food"" in general. The consensus here is ""food"" with a focus on quality.

2. **Sentiment Intensity Score for Group 1:**
   The agents provided intensity scores of 4 and 5. Given the consensus on the positive sentiment and the enthusiastic language (""Sooo good""), a score of 5 is justified.

3. **Category for Group 1**:
   Aligning with both ""tacos"" and ""food"", the ""food quality"" category is most appropriate according to the predominant aspect mentioned by the agents.

4. **Aspect Term for Group 3:**
   The agents oscillated between ""tacos"" and ""portion size,"" but since tacos are mentioned in the context of being filling, the broader term ""portion size"" fits well.

5. **Sentiment Intensity and Category for Group 2 and Group 3:**
   The consensus on categories remains aligned. For prices, both ""restaurant prices"" and ""food prices"" were suggested, but due to the lack of clear differentiation in the text, relationship to generic ""prices"" was aggregated to ""restaurant prices"". 

6. **Sentiment Intensity Scores for Groups 2 and 3:**
   A moderate positive score of 3 captures the generally favorable sentiment expressed towards both prices and filling nature."

### Explanation:

1. **Aspect Term:** For the first group, ""lack of reviews"" was chosen because two agents agreed on the sentiment relation, while one was slightly different with no significant aspect variation. For the overall restaurant experience, ""overall experience"" was chosen as it most closely captured the sentiment across agents, factoring in the slight variations. For food items, the grouping of ""buffalo wings, Mac n cheese and yams"" together as a single aspect term reflects the sentiment analysis made around their statement about flavor.

2. **Aspect Category:** The conclusions reached cover ""restaurant miscellaneous"" for the first aspect and ""restaurant general"" for the experience, as consensus was evident across the analyses. ""Food quality"" was clearly emphasized by most agents regarding the food's flavorfulness and willingness to return.

3. **Opinion Term:** Extracted based on the agreement of multiple agents that significantly related opinion words to aspect terms, maintaining original form and phrasing to reflect sentiment accurately.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:** Consensus on sentiment polarity and intensity was prioritized, with a slight variance favoring average or modal scores when possible. This approach ensures a balanced representation of different analyses, with slight moderation reflecting agreement across varying intensities from agents."

It is also worth mentioning that the amount of food they give you is RIDICULOUSLY huge which makes it a great deal for the price, especially since it's delicious. My go-to order is almost always a (not so) small order of mozzarella fries with gravy, and as someone who has eaten authentic Canadian poutine multiple times, I can easily say that this comes very close to tasting like the real thing.

602,This place has soooo many flavors and choices! A bit pricey for me but it was well worth the splurge since it was hot earlier today. The death by chocolate is the most amazing chocolate flavor I have ever tasted! The crepes are also a good choice but I wish it were crispier (just my preference).

603,"If you're expecting to come here on the weekend I would recommend making a reservation. Today I had a large party of 8 and even after checking the website I did not believe we needed to make reservations. 

The host recommended to come back after 4 not even asking if we wanted to add our party to the waitlist, this led me to believe the establishment was reservations only. She also suggested we order to go. 

Hmmm at this point it was our best option. We head over to the bar to order. The bartender/server was not nice or attentive. We ordered the Voodoo rice and the portion was definitely small for a rice appetizer. I'm pretty sure we had more cheese than rice.

605,"Ahhh Fuku always seems to disappoint me. Service was lousy - every time I go here there seems to be a whole new staff of servers who have no idea what's going on. Most of them are somewhat visually appealing (the girls) which I am pretty sure is the only reason they were hired. 
Sake bombs used to be good here but now they literally serve their sake bombs AND sake in clear plastic Solo cups. WTF. 
I will say that this place does get really rowdy especially on the weekends. 
I will continue to go here just because it's fun if you go with a big group or for some moderately overpriced sushi.","```json

Now they also host fun events and parties on different nights and that really is a great representation of the amazing culture of this city.

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Pizza:** All agents agree that the sentiment expressed about the pizza is strongly positive, with consensus on the ""best"" and ""EVER!!!!"" opinions. The sentiment intensity score of 5 reflects the strong positive sentiment. The competition aspect was interpreted differently, but majority considered it under ""food quality"" with a positive sentiment.

2. **Competition:** Majority interpretation leaned towards relating competition to the quality of the pizza, thus it was included as a positive sentiment under ""food quality"" with an intensity score of 3 to reflect the competitive aspect positively.

3. **Owner and cooks:** All agents agree on ""fantastic"" being a positive opinion term for the ""owner and cooks,"" with sentiment intensity consistently rated at 4 under the category of ""service general.""

4. **Pies:** All three agents agree that the sentence about ordering three pies does not convey a sentiment, thus it is neutral with a category of ""food general."""

**Explanation:**
- **Restaurant General:** All three agents agreed on the negative sentiment towards ""Buddy Freddy's"" with high intensity scores, reflecting strong disappointment.
- **Food Quality:** The distinct items ""corn casserole,"" ""broccoli casserole,"" and ""rutabagas"" consistently had negative evaluations from all agents, leading to a consolidated view of their failure in taste.
- **Ambience General:** The positive sentiment about the ""smell"" was consistently noted, even though it didn't impact the overall food quality appreciation.
- **Food Style Options:** Multiple agents recognized the distinction in the buffet style presentation from Fred's and marked it negatively.
- **Location General vs. Restaurant General:** The decision was made to classify comments regarding choosing not to return to Buddy Freddy's under ""location general"" as it reflects the choice of visiting the restaurant itself rather than commenting on its general operations or service."

**Consolidation Rationale:**  
1. **Aspect Term and Sentences:**
   - ""waitist"" and ""Awsome, waitist was very nice."" were consistently identified as relating to ""service general"" with a positive sentiment across all agents, although Agent 2 only used ""very nice.""
   - There's agreement on ""clean"" or its variation ""cleanliness"" indicating something positive or neutral about the atmosphere, though Agent 2 classified it as neutral for ""ambience general.""
   - All agents uniformly recognized ""sooo delicious!!!!"" as referring to ""food quality"" with a strong positive sentiment.

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - ""waitist"" consistently mapped to ""service general.""
   - ""clean"" was consistently associated with ""ambience general.""
   - ""delicious"" was linked to ""food quality.""

3. **Opinion Term, Sentiment Polarity, and Intensity Score:**
   - For the service aspect, the inclusion of ""Awsome"" alongside ""very nice"" from Agents 1 and 3 enhanced the sentiment intensity.
   - While agents had disparity in opinion regarding the intensity for ""clean,"" the neutral sentiment from Agent 2 has been chosen, reflecting a balanced view.
   - ""sooo delicious!!!!"" was unanimously agreed upon as intensely positive with a score of 5.

By integrating these observations, a finalized, comprehensive analysis of the text was crafted."

Also i was pleasantly surprised the the food was as good as it was, I had their signature teryiaki burger and it was awesome. Our waitress was very friendly and did a great job serving a table of 6 people and keeping up with us. The only real thing that was a problem was that their overflow parking is about 1/4 to 1/2 mile away down a dimly lit road in the back of a boat hanger but other than that this ia a place i would like to visit again for sure!!!","```json

Love the BBQ shrimp here but it's not quite Pascal Manale's - the lovely dinning room at Mr. B's makes it a close call (don't get me wrong the BBQ shrimp here is awesome) but when I'm at Mr B's I get the rabbit.

659,"I love finding and supporting good local businesses whenever I can. There is a starbucks right next door, but I'm glad I chose this place instead. The service is good, food is tasty, and the ambience is cozy and casual. They have both indoor and outdoor seating (I sat outside since the weather was cooler for a change). The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the parking lot is waaaay too small and I had to park down the street. Their food menu is also really short, with only a handful of options, none of which were a salad. I ordered the early bird special with kale and apple jam.

### Explanation:
- **Group 1:** All agents identified the sentiment regarding the restaurant as a ""hidden gem"" with positive sentiment, categorizing it under ""restaurant general."" A consistent intensity score of 4 was decided upon based on all agents' evaluations.
  
- **Group 2:** The aspect term ""bbq"" was universally acknowledged with the highest positive sentiment primarily focused on quality, as indicated by expressions like ""The best"" and ""sooo flavorful."" The opinion terms were consolidated, and an intensity score of 5 was agreed upon.

- **Group 3:** ""Experience"" and ""recommendation"" were frequently mentioned, with a focus on returning and recommending the place. Incorporating the most dominant terms ""definitely be back"" and ""recommends everyone"" captured the essence across the agents, fitting under ""restaurant general"" rather than ""restaurant miscellaneous"" for coherent classification. The sentiment intensity score here was harmonized to 4."

**Reconciliation and Integration:**

1. **Aspect Term ""white castle""**: Two agents categorized this as ""location general"" and one as ""restaurant general"". Given that the term implies a specific establishment within a location context, ""location general"" is selected. Sentiment opinions and scores corroborate a strong positive sentiment, maintaining an intensity score of 5.

2. **Aspect Term ""staff""**: All agents agree on the aspect term and sentiment polarity. Intensity scores of 4 and 5 were given, indicative of a strong positive sentiment. A score of 4 is determined as appropriate due to the consistency across two outputs for scoring consistency. The category ""service general"" is consistent across all outputs.

3. **Aspect Term ""food""**: All agents identified this and aligned on ""food quality"" as the category with ""best tasting"" as a defining sentiment, scoring it at a 5 to emphasize the strong positive sentiment across the text.

4. **Aspect Term ""experience""**: Consistently indicated in terms of category and sentiment polarity, maintaining a strong positive score of 5 as the sentiment intensity due to unanimous sentiment expression."

**Explanation:**

1. **Fried Chicken**: All three agents identified ""fried chicken"" as an aspect with a positive sentiment, supported by the opinion term ""Absolutely the best."" The sentiment intensity score of 5 and the category ""food quality"" are consistent across agents.

2. **Service**: All three agents agree on ""service"" as the aspect with a positive sentiment, associated with the opinion term ""Excellent."" A sentiment intensity score of 4 within the category ""service general"" is also unanimous across agents.

3. **Lunch Buffet**: Differing opinions were present on observed details such as ""baked chicken,"" ""dirty rice,"" etc., with no substantial opinion terms or extreme sentiments. The results have been reconciled to a more general ""lunch buffet"" aspect term, with a consensus of neutral sentiment and a sentiment intensity score of 0. The category is placed under ""food general"" as it encompasses all sub-food items served. 

The other detailed items and aspect categories like ""food style_options"" or ""food general"" had neutral sentiments with no explicit opinion terms offered, thus were omitted for simplicity and due to overlapping interpretations. The main focus remains on overall perception as outlined in the text provided."

All you can eat crabs, sushi, shrimp, crawfish, pizza, chicken fingers, Thai wings, and for the breakfast lover like myself ; the best waffles (didn't even need the butter or awesome blueberry spread but it's worth it to put that on there too or there's strawberry) they had an omelet station as well as a salmon station with Fresh cut fish and beef. There was a chocolate fountain and all the sweets you can imagine (amazing cherry pie, marshmallows, pound cake, fresh strawberries and pineapple)  I am probably forgetting a lot. But all of it was scrumptious. There was a create your own Bloody Mary station or you could get sangria, mojito, margaritas , or mimosa   (Oh the vodka was infused w/ jalepeno or citrus- omg so amazing) this is definitely where you come if you are hungry and especially worth it just for the crab legs alone. Perfectly steamed - we didn't even need a utensil to crack it open and it was so fresh. If I was not on a diet I would come once a pay period but this is my new guilty pleasure that I plan on making a monthly tradition.

683,"Okay, the burgers here are exceptional!!! We came in for lunch based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We just got pretty basic cheeseburgers (the ""petite"" order gets you two little ones) but they were out of this world. Sweet potato fries were great too, the wings were good, and the service was great! Yeah it's a smoking bar, but they must have some kind of mega filtration system because we're not smokers and could barely tell.

Bathrooms could be a lot cleaner, and the music selection was way heavy on the Maroon 5 and breathy female singer-songwriters (it sounded like what somebody might pick for the soundtrack to a movie about a teen girl), but maybe we just got a weird day.

Overall we loved it and will definitely be back to try some of their really interesting sounding burgers!","Final Consolidated Results:

**Explanation:**  
The final output consolidates the results from the three agents, resolving discrepancies as follows:
- The sentiment scores and polarity are averaged where discrepancies exist, considering contextual evidence from the input text and agent results.
- The opinion terms are unified to include significant terms from all agents.
- The aspect terms and categories are adjusted to match the strongest evidence provided by the agents.  
- For ""overall experience"" and ""burgers,"" the aspect terms were considered separately for ""food quality"" and ""restaurant general"" categories based on contextual alignment."

**Final Conclusion:**
- The order process has a negative perception due to the inconvenience caused by the long drive and the unavailability of the ordered food.
- The quality of food is recognized as good, but mixed sentiments arise due to the unprofessional conduct experienced.
- Service quality is perceived negatively, identified by the staff's indifference to the customer's effort.
- The location aspect holds a negative sentiment as it relates to the strenuous travel for a lack of reward."

It's a BYOB so come prepared with some wine or beer! There is indoor and outdoor seating and either space would be enjoyable. They give you complimentary pickles before your meal and man, they are really delicious! They even have the recipe for it painted on their wall.

We ordered 2 pizzas - first was their corn pizza and the other was the meat. Both were super delicious, you can't go wrong. 

Overall, the service, atmosphere and food were all really great and I look forward to coming back.","Final ABSA Results:

The final output integrates the analyses from the three agents, ensuring consistency in aspect terms, opinion terms, sentiment polarity, and sentiment intensity scores. The main reconciliation was necessary for the sentiment intensity score of the service aspect, where differing opinions from agents led to a conclusion of an intensity score of 4. This was reached by acknowledging the strength of sentiment in the phrase ""great,"" aligning with Agent 3's higher score evaluation."

696,"This place is another pizza heaven. The calzones and the salads are plentiful and flavorful. I have been here twice and tired different things both times and the first experience was better then the second, not because of the atmosphere or workers there simply because for my palate I didn't make the best choice on calzone. I would highly recommend this place, not only do they have a cool place to enjoy mouthfuls of delight, they have an awesome selection of beers and sodas. Next time I'm going to make my own calzone and I am excited to go back! Don't worry about the large portions, if you have to take it home, it heats up very nicely, almost as tasty as straight from their oven. Also, try a different sauce with the calzones then you would expect. The queso and honey mustard dipping sauce are fantastic, adds to the experience and party in your mouth! Great place to take the entire family. Mmmm mmmm good!","```

**Rationale:**

1. **""sake hana"" analysis:** All agents agreed on the aspect term ""sake hana"" with a positive sentiment and a high sentiment intensity score. The category was adjusted to ""drinks style_options"" as it better captures the opinion term ""Loooove"", which suggests a deep appreciation or subjective preference for the style or offering of sake hana.

2. **Food items (""Spider roll, chicken lo mein, spring roll, general tso, golden bags"") analysis:** There was variation among agents on how these items were classified and assessed. However, the opinion ""Yum! Yum!"" was strongly associated with a positive sentiment in Agent 2's analysis, which distinctly registered as an expression of food quality. We selected ""Spider roll"" as the specific aspect term most aligned with the positive sentiment, categorizing it under ""food quality"".

3. **Pricing analysis:** All agents recognized the price aspect as positive, with variations in the sentiment intensity score. The term was unified to ""restaurant pricing"" to generalize the pricing aspect, and the intensity score is moderated to 3 to align with the moderate positive sentiment collectively indicated. The opinion term includes both ""pricey"" and ""worth it"" to capture both the recognition of higher pricing and subsequent satisfaction."

### Summary:
The final analysis harmonizes the findings from the three agents. Key aspects like ""food"", ""waitress"", and ""owners & chef"" consistently receive strong positive sentiments. Discrepancies like treating ""owners & chef"" separately are merged as one aspect for clarity. Explicit mentions of different food items, particularly ""Brie"", ""shrimp cocktail"", etc., are consolidated. The recurring neutral mention of ""atmosphere"" is acknowledged, reflecting the varied agent emphasis."

Everyone in there had their laptops out and the tables were almost set up so that they could be used perfectly as a little desk. The best spot in the house is at the front where there is a little nook with two tables and a view of St. Charles.

**Consolidated Rationale:**

1. **Drinks Prices**: There is acknowledgement of disparity in drink pricing from two rounds of orders, leading to a mix of negative feeling towards higher costs initially, contrasted with a positive note for the correction. This gives a **mixed** sentiment with a **slight negative intensity** due to the initial strong negative sentiment being somewhat mitigated by the second lower price.

2. **Over Charging**: Clearly perceived as overcharging for drinks, reinforced by multiple agents describing it negatively with strong language, leading to a **strong negative sentiment** with a **-4 intensity**.

3. **Thief Bartender**: Strong negative sentiment observed universally across agents, labeling the bartender's actions as potentially job-threatening theft. Consistently severe language across findings allows classification as **strong negative** with **maximum negative intensity**.

4. **Consumer Beware**: One agent highlights a broader cautionary warning for consumers, categorized under **restaurant miscellaneous** with a **moderately strong negative sentiment** due to encouragement of caution, regardless of the issue specifics."

722,"So yesterday, the 90 degree temps kept me close to the office.  I was soooo hungry, but had no idea what to get.  So - I called up old faithful, I mean, Old Nelson and ordered a Cobb salad (a deviation from my usual chicken salad sandwich or liverwurst on rye) and it was soooooo disappointing.  I was hoping for nice thick bacon, but instead I got glorified bacon bits (not really 1980s bacon bits, but very reminiscent).  I was also hoping for a nice peppery ranch dressing, but unfortunately I got something that tasted like a ""no frills"" store brand ranch.  The chicken also left a lot to be desired, the seasoning was just off - too sweet, or too something.  Basically, my meal was tremendously underwhelming and after a few bites I found myself a little skeeved and peeved by the abundance of lettuce and shady lady chicken strips.  Old Nelson is so close to my office that I will likely be back, but probably only for the chicken salad sandwich on rye.  Or maybe, I'll just walk the extra block and enjoy a vanilla cone w/ rainbow sprinkles from Dairy Queen, that girl never disappoints!","[

**Explanation:**

- **Group Id 1:** All agents agree that ""study place"" is the aspect term. The majority agree on the category being ""ambience general,"" and the sentiment intensity primarily leans towards 5, establishing a strong positive sentiment overall.
- **Group Id 2:** There is a unanimous agreement on the aspect term ""cubano,"" the opinion term ""fantastic!"", and the sentiment polarity being positive with an intensity score of 4. The category is ""food quality.""
- **Group Id 3:** There is some discrepancy regarding the aspect term, but the prevalent term across analyses is ""chain coffeeshops."" The opinion term and sentiment intensity vary, but the majority view supports a negative sentiment with an intensity of -2 within the ""ambience general"" category. This reflects a balance between the challenges (""busy hustle and bustle"") and what has been long-awaited (""what I've been missing!"")."

**Explanation:**

- **Aspect Term:** The consensus for the aspect related to service revolves around variations of ""Chris the owner."" I chose ""Chris the owner"" to recognize both Chris and their role.
  
- **Opinion Term:** Across the agents, common opinion terms such as ""soooo nice,"" ""welcoming,"" ""amazing!!!,"" and ""like family!!!"" frequently appear, capturing the positive sentiment well.

- **Sentiment Polarity:** All agents agree on a positive sentiment.

- **Sentiment Intensity Score:** Both the ""service general"" and ""food quality"" categories receive consistently high intensity scores, generally trending towards a score of 5. Therefore, I assigned the maximum, supported intensity score.

- **Category:** All aspects were consistently categorized correctly per the predefined categories."

The food is made to order and extremely fresh. I ordered a chicken sandwich today and was impressed with the portion size and flavor. The prices are fair for the amount of food you get.

**Explanation:**

- For **aspect term** related to cleanliness, Agent 1's and Agent 3's analyses of ""cleanliness"" with opinions ""filthy"" and ""not clean"" were consistent and effectively merged for the final output. Both agents agreed on the negative sentiment and an intensity score of -4, which aligns with the observations from the text.
  
- The additional aspect, identified across Agent 2 and 3 regarding the experience of exiting, is included as ""exit experience"" to capture the intensity and sentiment, reflecting the explicit action. ""Exit experience"" encompasses the sentiment broadly reported as negative in both instances, with a consensus score of -5 for intensity."
742,"Taste: I really enjoy Tex-Mex food seeing as I also grew up with it and I just say it is bursting with LOTS of flavor!!! I'm not a fan of vegetarian/vegan options, but even the tofu taco had flavor that made me for a moment re-evaluate my life decisions. Only thing that lacks is a wow factor; but other than that it's a solid Tex-mex place.

Impression: Very cute place to have a very chill place for tacos. We wanted a very non-chalant place for food Friday night so we came here. I'm a sucker for the string lights and the refurbished bus made into a kitchen!!!

Price: Reasonable! Portion sizes could be better.

Service: No complaints we got our food nice and hot! It's a self serve/dive spot vibe so after ordering, you are able to sit anywhere you want and they'll bring food to you.","```json

### Consolidation Explanation:
1. **Restaurant General Aspect**:
   - The aspect term ""experience"" attaching the phrases ""This is awesome!!!!!!!"" combines Agent 1's and the overall sentiment. Agent 2 has a similar notion with a 5 intensity score.
   - Both agents identify the intense positive sentiment towards the general restaurant experience, supported by I go to this spot every week. This reflects commitment and satisfaction, thus categorizing and scoring it as such.

2. **Food Quality Aspect (Bon bu hue)**:
   - All agents agree on ""Bon bu hue"" with the opinion terms ""so great!!!!!!"" and ""love it !!!!!!!!."" Thus, the sentiment is consolidated to positive with high intensity due to uniform consensus on intensity score 5.

3. **Location General Aspect (Neutral)**:
   - There was a discrepancy in what constitutes the aspect. However, the location aspect is addressed neutrally with Agent 2 and 3's reference to ""I go to this spot every week"" being an observation rather than distinct positive opinion, thereby marked neutral with 0 intensity."

Portion sizes are great as well, was able to get two servings from this. I opted for the NY strip steak with mash and broccoli plus a lobster tail. Soooooo goooood!! The mash potatoes were rich and flavorful , the broccoli was fresh and tasty, the steak was prepared and seasoned perfectly. (So good i didn't even use my trusty A1 sauce). & the lobster tail was very tender and fresh. Everything was just so good. Will definitely be back.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

**Explanation:**
1. **Coffee** was consolidated into one group, considering both general opinion and specifically about free re-fills and the positive ambiance of enjoying iced coffee outside.
2. **Decaf** maintained a negative sentiment due to lack of variety in decaf options, identified similarly by two agents.
3. **Wi-fi Connection** consistently evaluated positively across all agents.
4. Analysis of lunch and specific dishes (such as the white fish salad) was consolidated towards a focus on food quality, as suggested by Agent 1.
5. **Working Remotely** determined to have mixed sentiment—a positive sentiment for the spot but negative concern about overcrowding, consolidated into the ambiance general category."

When my fiancé and I when on Friday night we definitely did not expect it to be as busy as it was. They have a great cocktail list amazing specials and an outstanding food that leaves you meticulously reviewing the menu deciding what you should order. The waitstaff and the bartenders are very friendly although regarding speed of service you can tell that they're definitely overwhelmed at the overall busyness of the restaurant.

### Conclusion:

After reconciling the analyses from the three LLM agents, the final consolidated results are as follows:

1. **Pat's**: There is a unanimous agreement that Pat's is seen very positively. The opinion terms ""A must stop"" and ""Amazing!"" are consistently reflected, leading to a classification under ""restaurant general"" instead of ""location general"", which aligns more accurately with the sentiment. We've assigned a sentiment intensity score of 5, indicating a strong positive sentiment.

2. **Steak n Cheese**: All agents agree on the aspect term ""Steak n Cheese"" and the related opinion terms ""juiciest"" and ""ever had"", assigning a strong positive sentiment with an intensity score of 5, correctly categorizing it under ""food quality"".

3. **authentic Philly Pat's Style**: While the aspect term has variations (Agent 2 uses the full ""authentic Philly Pat's Style""), there is consensus on the opinion term ""sooooo goood!!!"" and the positive perception, which warrants a sentiment intensity score of 5 and categorization under ""food style_options""."

### Justification for Consolidation:

1. **""full pour tour"" Aspect and Sentiment**: Both Agents 1 and 3 identified ""full pour tour"" as the aspect term with a ""great time"" opinion, assigning it under ""drinks style_options"". Sentiment is consistently positive, with intensity scores ranging from 2 to 4. A balanced score of 3 is chosen to represent the consensus.

2. **Location Aspects**: All agents agree that ""pinellas ale works"", ""3 daughters"", and ""diasent brewies"" are location aspects with neutral sentiment and fall under ""location general"". These entries are consolidated with consistent neutral sentiments.

3. **""tour"" Aspect and Sentiment**: Agents labeled the ""tour"" with varying sentiment intensity scores and categories. Both Agents 1 and 2 noted sentiment under categories either relating to restaurants or hospitality. The consensus aspects see ""tour"" under ""restaurant miscellaneous"" with a sentiment intensity score of 3 as a middle ground, given the emphasis on promotion ""now!!!"", which conveys a positive urgency."

### Rationale:
1. **Aspect Term and Opinion Term:** I combined the analyses from all agents to ensure comprehensive coverage of aspect terms and opinions. For instance, the ""owners"" term was consistently tagged, with varying opinion phrases like ""Hmmmmm"" and ""something changed!"". These were included to capture the neutral sentiment expressed towards potential changes in ownership.

2. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:**
   - **Pizza:** Consistently regarded negatively by all agents, though with differing intensity scores. I've standardized the intensity at -2, reflecting the moderate negative sentiment expressed by comparisons to ""little caesars"".
   - **Flavors:** All agents noted a negative sentiment due to the loss of flavor, with intensity peaking at -3 to capture this dissatisfaction.
   - **Crust:** While one agent noted a neutral perspective, the repetition of ""frozen crust"" in a questioning tone suggests a negative inference, leading to a consolidated score of -2 for slight negativity.

3. **Categories:** I ensured each aspect was placed in the most fitting category. For example, ""owners"" and associated sentiments were universally categorized under ""restaurant miscellaneous"". 

This consolidation takes the strongest aspects from each agent's perspective and formulates a balanced and cohesive final output."

**Rationale for Consolidation:**

1. **Express Grub delivery** was generally recognized as having a positive sentiment due to ""AMAZING!!!"". Most agents placed this under ""service general"", but an argument was made for ""food general"" based on the text context. The consensus was to categorize it under ""service general"" as ""delivery"" aligns with service aspects.
   
2. **Food selection** aspect: The phrase ""wouldn't consider"" was commonly identified as negative, regarding its style, not meeting typical diner expectations. This analysis led to a more neutral negative perception due to no explicit dissatisfaction; however, the sentiment wasn't intensely negative to warrant the strong scores suggested.

3. **Quality of the food** and **burgers** had consistently strong positive appraisals (5) across different agents for each aspect and were hence streamlined to reflect a positive sentiment related to ""food quality.""

4. **Interior** and its ""super cute"" opinion term consistently received positive feedback with minor variance in intensity scoring between the agents. Consensus here favors a strong positive classification. 

These decisions reflect a balanced interpretation, adopting elements of each agent's analysis while standardizing categories and scoring based on the preponderance of evidence and logical coherence from the input text."

The ambiance is fun, low, romantic lighting with pops of red. Three floors of people watching. I felt like it was necessary to be dressed up; nice button down shirt and jeans for guys and nice dress or top for ladies.

I thought the food and drinks were all amazing, but I left the restaurant hungry, and that shouldn't happen when it is that expensive.

I can personally attest that the following are delicious:
Panela Chilean Sea Bass- Really well cooked with great flavor
Maine Diver Scallops
Beef Tenderloin

1. **Group 1:** There is agreement that ""great,"" ""crappy,"" and ""love it!!!"" refer to the overall sentiment of the ""restaurant/place"" and the sentiment is ""positive"". The consolidated sentiment intensity score is set to 4, balancing strong positivity with the mixed input of both positive and negative opinions.

2. **Group 2:** Consensus across agents on the recommendation of Clearwater Beach with ""must try"" showing strong positivity, classified under ""location general.""

3. **Group 3:** Consistency from agents 1 and 2 on ""al fresco dining"" being positive under ""food style_options"" ensures alignment and the sentiment intensity score reflects moderate positivity.

4. **Group 4:** All agents marked the aspect as ""menu"" with neutral sentiment, reflecting a factual statement of choices.

5. **Group 5:** All agents identify the negative sentiment about ""wait time"". The higher intensity score reflects the strong negativity of ""wait forever.""

6. **Group 6:** Consolidation from agent 2 and agent 3 findings about post-dining activities classified under ""restaurant miscellaneous,"" with moderate positive sentiment for having plenty of post-dining time."

Literally could have ate like 20 of them! And my pad Thai was so so so delicious. The fried tofu on both our dishes were so perfectly fried on the outside but soft on the inside.

**Reconciliation Notes:**

- **Latte:** There was consensus among Agents 2 and 3 that ""latte"" should be treated under 'drinks quality' with a strong positive sentiment based on the term ""in food heaven"". The intensity score was agreed at 5.
  
- **Breakfast Bread Pudding:** Also agreed upon by Agents 2 and 3 as having strong, positive sentiment described again as ""in food heaven"" with an intensity score of 5, categorized under 'food quality'.

- **Parisian Pastries:** All agents identified ""Parisian pastries"" with the opinion ""soooooo good"", defining the sentiment as strong positive, hence a score of 5 in 'food quality'.

- **Staff:** Consistently identified by all agents with the sentiment term ""sweet"", classified as 'service general', and a moderate positive intensity score of 2.

- **Leather Chair/Ambiance:** There was a general match where Agents 2 and 3 aligned more closely recognizing the ambiance element through the ""leather chair"" with ""enjoyable"". They shared a moderate positive sentiment with an intensity score of 2, under 'ambience general'. The term ""Yum!"" used by Agent 1 was seen to reinforce the general positivity but was not essential to the primary analysis of ambiance."

### Consolidation Notes:
1. **Soft Serve Analysis:**
   - All agents identified 'soft serve', but opinions varied initially across different result groups.
   - Majority trend shows positive sentiment with a high intensity on its taste ('soooo good'), so that opinion and category choice ('food quality') holds.
   - Grouped relevant sentences showing current menus and quality.

2. **Pumpkin Soft Serve Feature:**
   - Recognized separately for its introduction; sentiment is neutral, reflecting a factual statement ('Finally').
   - Category is 'food style_options' as it focuses on menu style and novelty.

3. **White Dotte Recommendation:**
   - Consensus shows positive sentiment ('need to go'), best fitting 'location general' as this refers broadly to White Dotte's appeal.
   - Intensity score averages toward a moderate positive intensity.

4. **Flavors:**
   - Uniformly deemed neutral regarding weekly variation, linking to 'food style_options'.
   - No present opinion term was consistent across agents, so left as neutral."

853,"Came here since I was in town for work. Was craving some asian and saw this asian fusion place and decided to give it a try.

The vibe I got walking in was that this place was fancy. Everything from tablecloth to servers coming and offering sparkling water to servers reading out specials, this was a fancy schmancy asian fusion place. 

Our server had some serious B.O..... only reason I pointed this out was because he came over and read out like 20 different ""specials"" so he stood next to me for quite a bit. I couldn't focus on what he was saying. By the time he read his 8th special, I had forgotten what he said for the past 3 minutes. It just left a nasty taste on my taste buds. not good buddy. not good at all.

Food. I got the golden bags since everyone seemed to rave about it as an appetizer and got the pad thai for dinner. The Golden Bags were good... but just good. In terms of taste, it gave you the illusion it was different and better because of the way it's presented. Instead of a roll, it's wrapped as a bag so the filling is more grouped together instead of spaced out thinly in a roll. So A+ on presentation. The Pad Thai was average. Let's just say it wasn't amazing. Would definitely try one of their other 20 items on the menu.","```json

854,"Menu: Uninspired $$$ American (there were very few Creole/Cajun dishes) Some meat in some boring sauce with a side of veggies.

But the question remains to this day:: how could the hype around such a simple dish so grossly contradict my own dining experience???? Chicken under the Brick, to me, was more like Chicken swimming in Teriyaki Sauce. The reduction might as well have been balsamic vinegar overloaded with sugar. Gross. The meat wasn't dry, but lacked luster since the sauce had not completely seeped into the meat. Without exaggeration, it wins the award for the most disappointing dish ever. 

The building that houses the restaurant is actually a renovated home on a residential block which affords an intimate and yet familial setting. 

My dining companions reported to have enjoyed their dishes. However, I don't plan on returning anytime soon...a contemporary American cuisine needs to create an innovative, themed menu in order to stand out. Dante's Kitchen, in my opinion, didn't.","```json

**Explanation:**

- **Group 1:** The three agents generally agreed on the aspect term ""menu"", the opinions ""Uninspired $$$ American"" and ""very few"", and the category ""food style_options"". There was some variation in intensity scores, but -3 was a common ground based on the collective agreement of negativity and intensity between agents.

- **Group 2 & 3:** These were merged into a comprehensive entry for ""Chicken under the Brick"" and ""the meat"", reflecting overall negative sentiment regarding ""food quality"". The sentiment intensity score was drawn from common focus on intense dissatisfaction.

- **Group 4:** The term ""building"" best aligned with agent 2 and 3, tying it to ambience. The positive sentiment was consistent across all agents with similar intensity scores.

- **Group 5:** Aspects regarding ""dining companions"" reflected enjoyment, noted by two agents. The intensity score of 2 captures moderate positivity.

- **Group 6:** This group summarised the general negative sentiment toward Dante's Kitchen. Except variations in sentiment intensity from agent outputs, a moderate score of -3 indicated broad agreement about the lack of satisfaction with this aspect."
855,"Easy, free parking and a cozy Turkish ambiance.

My sister and I were seated right away. However, it took us 10 minutes to get a menu.... 

Two people working the small room - a man and a woman. And yet we had to flag them down for water. I was wondering if they were also partially cooking the food in the back as well.

We ordered the Appetizer Combo for two, the Bosphorous Special, a Chicken Kebab plate and one Baklava. 

Way.too.much.food.

Our waiter admitted it at the end, but I'm disappointed the guy didn't tell us upfront. 

Knowing what I know now, I'd skip the combo and go straight for the Baba Ghanoush, their best dip. 

Then I would share the Special with my sister and not have to take home (3) styrofoam boxes.... 

The Baklava was decent. Not warm and two forks only made it a pain to cut through. You need a knife for that one. 

I compliment them on cutting the Pita bread into bite sized pieces. The bread lasts longer for both the customer and business.

I take offense that the some of the bread was burnt black a bit, affecting the taste. Also, we did not get a refill of the bread when we asked.

I didn't find either waiter to be engaging at all. The guy stood an extra (2) feet from the table, made no recommendations, and honestly wanted to get out of there. The place wasn't packed, but whatever was causing his rush affected his presence and thus charisma. A little too soft spoken for my taste. 

The food was above average. Fairly priced. Light aqua club kind of music. Again, cool decor. I enjoyed the candy by the door. 

Yeah, check this place out. But be smart with how/what you order.","Based on the analysis from the three LLM agents, here is a consolidated Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) output:

well, two out of three aint bad.

this place is your typical diner with typical diner fare (nothing to write home about, but definitely hits the spot when you want cheap & filling) the kind of place where you get the check before you have swallowed your first bite. 

there are also some real characters sitting at the counter. more than once i have seen a dude there that is a dead-ringer for bill murray!.. (baby steps to four o'clock..)

857,"So lets start off by saying we had to wait about an hour and a half for a table.. didnt mind so much since it was nice out and we went walking around all the little shops.  So the second thing, all the staff are REALLY nice.  

Our order consisted of the following;
Mild wings
Small basket of onion rings, and sloppy fries.
2 small burgers
1 big ugly
1 coney dog
And chicken strips for my baby sis.

I loveeee wings, guess this was the wrong place to come to for my craving.  They were really juicy but lacking in flavor.  My burger was too... it needed salt.  & by the time I bit into the other half the bun was very soggy, not the good kinda soggy.. but just wet.  Not very tasty.  The mushrooms i asked for that they charged extra for.. they were flavorless.  & not to mention there was only like 3 or 4 slices of em on my burger.  

The chile is veryyyyy good though. If i ever come here again, i'll probably stick with that and some onion rings because they were delicious.  This place wasn't that great really. Especially for the very long wait!  Steak and shake burgers are tastier in my opinion!","```

860,"I've been dying to try Bogart's, but every time i was near the joint, the line was always wrapped around the corner... Ain't nobody got time for that! However, I finally got a chance to try it during my lunch... on a Tuesday. 


The Customer service was good; the guy behind the register was pretty nice and suggested a side (the baked beans) to go along with my pulled pork sandwich. The inside is super duper tiny so either get your food to go, eat outside (if weather permits) or get there early!  The pulled pork was nice and tender! AND THAT BUN.......... DEE. LISH. Super soft and buttery.  The baked beans were delicious and the deviled egg potato salad was ok too. I just wished it was a tad bit sweeter, but that's just me tho! Their BBQ sauces were NOT a hit for me. Literally. 3 out of the 4 were BAD. Hence the 3 stars. The last sauce i tried & actually ate (it had a ""b"" on the lid) was JUST ok. That voodoo sauce was spicy as hell. They are a BBQ joint so I guess I was ready to be wow'd by their sauces. One sauce was so watery, I just..... Idk, but it was watery as hell. Lol. I would definitely come back and dine in so I can experience what that'd be like (& be able to order more food and not have to worry about falling asleep at my desk, hehe).

864,"This restaurant is quite hyped up, and was on Center City's restaurant week listing.  It had its good points, and bad points. I'll start with the good.

*  The food was quite tasty - my husband had the baby lamb chops, which were cooked really nicely with a subtle marinade. The highlight of his dish was the 'pear potato' - a deep fried mashed potato in the shape of a pear.

* I got the Iskender Kabob, which was quite good, but not what I expected. It's gyro meat on bread, but the bread is hidden under layers of meat and tomato sauce, and is cut up into tiny pieces so it basically dissolves by the time you get to it. The tomato sauce is very, very tasty, but the meal did not come with the hot sauces as promised in the menu.

* appetizers: feta cheese wrapped in filo was very good, and I'd recommend it.

*The Baklava was actually a really great surprise - I loved it (and I'm picky with Baklava)!

The bad points (ugh):
* The restaurant is painfully understaffed (or maybe it was just the night we were there?).  We had an 8pm reservation, but the hostess wasn't at the desk, and we waited 15 minutes just for someone to come and greet/seat us. Once we were at our table, it took another 10 minutes just to get menus, and another 40 minutes before they took our order! A couple who came in after us got their bread basket and menus right off the bad, making us unhappy customers. They just lack a bit of organization.

*The website promises free parking, but their parking lot would only fit about a fifth of their customer bank. So sad. We had to drive around for 40 minutes trying to find a spot (and the nearby parking lots were basically full) and finally had to pay $13 for dinner. On our walk to the restaurant, we were thinking, ""This better be worth it....""

*The Sauvingnon Blanc I ordered was OLD. I know my wine, and this was stale. My husband's Johnny Black and Soda came halfway into our meal (we ordered it when we first sat down). 

I'm feeling generous today, and I realize they are a family run restaurant so I don't want to slam them. I'm giving them 3 stars.","```json

865,"Get ready to trade in your walker for an electric scooter, this place is coming back to life!!!

This was a Jonathan's on it's way to a slow and painful death. Being a building, it could not move to a retirement community in Florida. So, the next best thing was to bring a piece of Florida to the building. Jonny from Florida bought the bar and has started the process of transforming it into something nice. There are still some slow nights with the 30+ local barflys sparsely inhabiting the copius amount of stools around this large bar. However, the owner has done a few things to really bring the life back to this bar.  There are great drink specials and reasonably good pizza. Wednesday night is an ever growing trivia extravaganza. The guy who runs it is a tool, but you can still have a lot of fun if you go with some friends. Thursday night is karaoke night. There are some bad locals, but also a few that will blow your mind. They also have a singles night and you never know what new and exciting thing they will have around the corner. When you walk in, it feels like a Jonathan's, but pretty soon you will realize that this is something new. It may not be really good yet, but I have a lot of hope. Maybe in a few months they can earn another star.","```json

To be fair, I'm pretty sure we paid $1.25 per wedge of potato, but at least the interesting sauce made up for it!

867,"Luckily we had a nice buzz going by the time we sat down to our reservation on Sunday night, or I really don't think we would have enjoyed our time here. This place your typical old school tourist trap (white coats and tuxes for the staff; white tablecloths).

Our server was kooky (in a good way) and kept the drinks comin', which is appreciated on Bourbon Street. 

We weren't super hungry so we just did apps. The food was fine but nothing particularly inspired: 

DH hated his gumbo (it had tons of shells in it, but not much meat...more like a bouillabaisse almost) and my endive salad was fine, but nothing I ever feel I need to eat again on purpose. We found the Shrimp Arnaud over-sauced. The Crab Claws were good but verrrryyy greasy (too much butter...I didn't know it was possible!). The Alligator Sausage was ok but tasted so much like kielbasa that it really wasn't anything special.   

The space is kind of stuck in a (1970's) time warp and is packed with bachelorette parties (screaming) and oldsters (turning up their hearing aids).

It's fine if you're into this kind of thing, but I know there are better places to eat in NOLA.","```json

For some reason I wandered off the beaten path towards the Warehouse District in search of this Magical Breakfast place called Deanie's Restaurant.  LOST!  I don't get lost easily cause usually I'm not looking for anything specific.  Epic Fail this be.  FOUND this place called Cochon Butcher open, empty and with the smell of sweet sweet Meat in the air. 

At first glance, I was curious at the Butcher section of various Meats in the Display Fridge. Premium would be the best word to describe it. With premium comes the associated cost as the economy dictates.  Obviously as a Visitor, I didn't intend to purchase any so TSA can make me one of their Canadian Bitches. Back to focusing on the Chalkboard Menu.... 3.5'd 

I wasn't actually reading anymore because I was starved.  I just wanted that Pork special you had on the sandwich-board out front.  Don't make me use my Grade-6 French on you.  Clueless still, I mumbled 'De lait' as if I'm asking for Milk but she understood.  Btw, she was cute along with a strong Southern accent. :D 

--------------------- 

Cochon de Lait Po-boy w/Pickled Cabbage & Buttermilk Dressing($10.00) 

Cochon de Lait was thinly shaved deli-style, quite tender as Suckling Pig should be.  Pickled Cabbage & Buttermilk Dressing kind of ruined the show although in their defense, it didn't cover up the Cochon's flavour as much since Cochon de Lait has lighter subtle flavours.  I was craving for some Crackling to kick-it-up-a-notch as another New Orleans notable would say. 

It wasn't all mediocre as there was this Yellow Magic in a Bottle on the table that saved the day.  The Red Bottle is typical Louisiana Red so I easily poured half the bottle of this Sweet Potato Habanero instead and used any leftover whatever to soak it up as if drinking Soup.  The mix of Sweet Potato and Apple Cider Vinegar gave it a Fruity flavour profile while smoothing out the Habanero for balance.","```json

876,"A date took me to Almond's last week and it was surprisingly slow (well, surprising to him, I had never been there).  I like the ambiance; definitely a nice ""date setting""....dark, candle light, etc.  Our waiter was very friendly, although, almost in that ""I'm talking in my waiter voice and this is not how I talk in real life"" kind of way.  The menu was written on a chalk board on the table.  Now, this is a cute idea, but not very helpful for a ""menu reader"" like me.  I like to be able to read what my food is going to be like before I order it.  I realized I could have asked the waiter (and we did about somethings), but I wasn't going to sit there and ask about everything on the menu.  We ordered this risotto of the day, which was risotto was peas and tomatoes.  It was pretty good.....very strong parmesan bite.  We each drank a glass of an Argentinian Malbec and it was delicious.  I wish I would have known the name of it!  I had stalked Almond's on Yelp before the date and decided that with all of it's rave reviews, I had to try the pan fried chicken.  I don't get the hype.  To me, it was a glorified chicken strip.  I was expecting pan-fried chicken like my mom made, where chicken is fried in just a half-inch of oil or so.  This was so uniformly cooked, I don't know how it could have been ""pan fried,"" unless it was deep-fried in a very large pan?  Not to mention, it was incredibly bland.  Even salt would have helped.  My date had the peppercorn filet.  It was delicious....although very very peppery.  I think if I were to return, I'd order it and ask for less peppercorns.  The meal came with mashed potatoes and green beans (which I remember being surprised about....until I remembered that I couldn't READ what came with the meal because there was no explanation on the menu).  The mashed potatoes were good and the green beans were okay.  Nothing unbelievable.  

I liked Almonds, but I won't be in a rush to return.  As pathetic as this sounds, I'd probably go there on a date again, but probably won't pay for a meal there myself.  :-/","```json

I had the porter (only dark beer on draft.. for Oct, I would have expected more dark beers) which was a good standard porter. Little smokey, which I like.
I had the pan fried turkey burger with pickled veggies (cuddos on more than just fries as a side option!) Sandwich was good and the sauce had nice flavor. Pretzel bun was good! I couldn't figure out if the turkey burger was homemade or not.. it was pretty uniform for a homemade burger....

882,"This is really 31/2 stars. This is a very cute restaurant and a BYOB (both big pluses), with a looooong menu! It really is overwhelming! The atmosphere is great, it's nice and loud, makes you feel like you're somewhere more hip. 

But back to the food and the menu. It is one of the longest menus I have ever seen. There are plenty of things that look and sound good but unfortunately my immediate reaction when I see such a large menu is that there is no way everything can be fresh. They did have a specials menu that changes every day so I would suggest sticking to ordering from there, just to be safe! 

We were a party of four so we all decided to try a couple of different things. We ended up starting with the mussels, oysters, frishee salad and the beet salad, as well as sharing a small order of the lobster mac n cheese. I had the mussels, and it was a HUGE order of mussels with plenty to share between 2 people. The mussels were very good in a tomatoey-vodka sauce. I also sampled the lobster mac n cheese which was good but not as rich as I had hoped but not bad by any means! 

For our main I tried the ""Fisherman's platter"" which consisted of small samples of salmon, tilapia, crab cake, and shrimp. It was pretty good, but I wasn't sure how everything fit in together. All the components individually were good, and it's good if you want to sample a lot of different things so next time you can order the one you liked the best! I do have to recommend the crab cakes which was awesome, lots of crab meat. 

All in all we had a really great dining experience. Dessert was ok, all our our cobblers and pies were cold which was a disspointment but the ice cream was delicious!   The loud ceilings makes the dining room loud, in a good way of course! Our waitress was very helpful and nice as well which added to the experience! 

Lastly, I hadn't been to Phoenixville in a long time, and it truly is going thru a major rejuvenation. That being said, it's still Phoenixville....unfortunately. Give it another 3-5 years and I'm sure not only the buildings but the atmosphere will be just like West Chester.","```json

884,"As far as take out Chinese goes in this part of Philly, this is by far my favorite. But it's still not as great as some of the greats in Chinatown, which I'm using as a gauge. Prices are decent and the employees are always friendly. 

I've gotten take-out a few times since they opened when a hankering for takeout Chinese hits. They also have sushi....so the menu is odd in that regard. But the sushi is decent - fantastic but better than what I expected.  To be honest I've only gotten cooked rolls here as I'm a little afraid to get anything raw at a place that is not specifically known for sushi.  

As far as the Chinese side of the menu goes, I've gotten wonton soup, veggie lo mein and sesame shrimp. All were pretty good for take out. 

Big downfall is that they don't deliver. But a bonus (for some) is that they have beer to go (maybe that's why they can't deliver?).

**Conclusion:** The differences among the agents' results were primarily related to terminology (""delivery"" vs. ""delivery staff"") and sentiment intensity scores. By evaluating the general trend of the results provided by the agents, the consolidated result averages the varying intensity scores for each aspect and harmonizes the aspect terms and categories accordingly, capturing the collective sentiment conveyed in the input document."
887,"Great place for happy hour, some apps maybe.

After hearing rave reviews and making reservations 2 times for this Mexican eatery, we finally made it there. 

The ambiance and location are great. Love the bar in the middle. Lighting and decor is awesome. 

We ordered macho nachoes which were really good. I ordered a Mojito which I have had better. I think it was a premade Mojito mix.

What was not great was sitting on a table near the bar and having folks' asses in our face all night. Had to ask a lady to move because her purse almost knocked the water off our table. 

Had to yell to have a conversation.

The entrees were were not so great and overpriced. I ordered the red sauce chicken enchilada that tasted like a regular enchilada smothered in Ragu sauce. I didn't finish my meal. My date ordered chicken tacos that were good but as they got cold the corn tortilla tasted bland and chewy.

Maybe next time I will order something lighter and choose an earlier time to be there. 

Anyway to request a red velvet booth away from 50 year old bar bros picking up 30 something ladies???","```json

I was so disappointed the last time my husband and I ordered from this restaurant. It has been my favorite since we moved to the area 4 years ago. 
 You know how the sweet and sour chicken is usually different from the type of chicken in, say, the General Tso's or Honey chicken? Not anymore at Egg Roll #1. It was all the same type of chicken, the sweet and sour type. And the sauces were very bland and just not good at all. I don't know where to get good Chinese food around here anymore! This place was my last hope after a couple unfavorable experiences at Great Wall. 
 From what I hear, the Vietnamese menu is much better. I will update my review if I end up trying something different. Maybe they put more of their focus on that menu since a lot of people come for the Pho and other items. I just want some good Chinese food  :(","[

Here is my biggest complaint. The food was not hot!!! I mean how can food served out of hot pans not be hot?? I am very confused. Everyone that I was with experienced the same problem. I for one am a fan of hot food so I probably had an instant 'tude which killed it for me.

893,"Was here for a business meeting. First of all, the service was superb! Our server was attentive, knowledgeable and humorous. A+++ on the service.
The ambiance is okay, albeit very outdated. Their menu is daily, but I'm not sure what that update entails. Their menu online is identical to the menu I held in my hands last night.
The food... 
~ Clams were okay, but I'm not a big seafood person so do not take my word for it. 
~ I am a HUGE steak person and I can tell a good steak from a bad one by just looking at it. My coworker ordered prime rib, their special, and thought it was great. I ordered filet mignon bearnaise, which was ruined by the bearnaise sauce. Grilled to perfection, and then smothered in less-than-average bearnaise sauce, yuck! 
~ My biggest disappointment; however, was yet to come. Our server told us that the side dishes serve two, but then we received 8 asparagus stalks. This is NO joke people: 8 stalks for 7 dollars. Really? 
~ The Creme Brulee was delicious, although the caramel top could have afforded more time under a torch.
In conclusion, if they offered a filet mignon that wasn't smothered in that sad attempt of a bearnaise sauce and served side dishes that are actually going to serve two people, I'd give them four stars.","```

896,"Many would probably gasp in shock that I chose to have a pitcher of PBR at Dino's on the evening of my birthday.... 

What can I say? The previous evening's celebration was the polar opposite with an exquisite dinner at Silo followed up by bottles of champagne at Patterson and I just wanted (or needed) a change of pace. I had always been curious about Dino's and thought that on the first night of my much-anticipated stay-cation, a $7 pitcher of Pabst sounded incredibly welcoming. Boy, was I right!

Although Dino's is barely the size of a master bedroom in a Brentwood McMansion, it keeps character with it's gritty yet cozy ambiance. Think 1970's VFW hall. The bartender/cook/manager/waitress titles all belong to one friendly and efficient lady. The other patrons ranged from truck drivers to hungover hipsters while the Republican National Convention was playing loudly on the TV. Hot damn, I'm in the South.
(On another note, what was Dirty Harry thinking?!)

I had a great time chit chatting away with my friend who helped me guzzle the vessel of brew while an amused older gentleman watched in awe. He finally asked me, "" Are you going to be able to drink that entire pitcher?"" I had to ask him to repeat himself a couple of times as his accent was heavy and albeit slurred. Once I finally translated what he said, I smiled and flexed my muscle and said. ""Hell. Yea.""

Am I going to be a regular at Dino's? Not likely. 
But, I am certainly not going to hate on Dino either. I enjoyed my low-key evening of cheap beer, gossip, and politics very much. I'm sure that I will sneak back for a little escape when I have a hankering to do so.

I'd like to come back and try some of the bar food for appetizers and then perhaps heads off to Catbird for dinner. Isn't that what life is all about?

897,"OK...I have a lay over in Philly. Two hour wait, excited to be going to Italy and eating all the pasta I can handle. I must first have my last American meal before going. When in Philly indulge in the cultural phenomonon called a cheese steak. I had a local experince with one of these little beauties,  http://www.yelp.com/biz/joeys-famous-philly-cheesesteaks-trenton#hrid:2uZh-dku02_iHRGrLV8HVQ/src:self, and I wasn't that impressed. So I wanted to give it another try along with a couple of beers. 
The cheesesteak I had was with onions and cheese, better known as wit and wiz....the cheese was a creamy white color not the usual orange cheese wiz with fries and a couple of america's famous Coors. The cheesesteak was steamy hot and the fries were hot. This was a pretty good sandwich, just not the best. It sat in my stomach for the eight hour flight like a rock. Unfortunately the cheese effected me and caused a gastomonic anomoly. Thank God for those overhead blowers on an airplane.","```json

898,"Sad!!! My recent visit to Milk and Honey really took this place down a notch. Though crowded on a Sunday at 11am, they got us seated well before the quoted 1h15m. So I was encouraged that one of my fave brunch spots was still hitting it out of the park. However, once at our table, it was a real let-down. Our server was nice, but very crazed. Our initial drink order (which we placed at the same time as our food) took 10+ minutes to be delivered, even though I saw them wilting at the bar for nearly the same duration. Our appetizer took almost 40min, and entrees came another 30 min after that! Our server who was very sweet, couldn't seem to offer any reason for the delays. She just kept telling us it'll be a while. At one point, we asked for some toast for our super hungry son. We said we'd pay for it, but needed something to tide him over. She said she would talk to her manager about it (huh???) and actually never brought it to us. The food was all very mediocre, and the portions were tiny. Upon paying, it was a relatively reasonable total, but I wasn't blown away by the experience for the price. Milk & Honey, please get it together...I think you have all the good components in place.

899,"Went here with a friend who loves buffets because of the value, and we had a coupon (of course). So $6.99 + 2 for a drink is still almost $10 per - not sure if the coupon was really worth clipping the coupon. 

We got there at 3:45 on a Sunday - since my friend goes there a lot, he knows the servers. His fav server came up and said she is getting off so good luck to us I suppose. We get seated and it took 10 min for our ""server"" (who really just brings drinks and takes away plates) to come and get our drink order, then another 5 min for him to come back with the drinks. Of course he apologized for taking so long, but really??? why??? you get drinks and take away plates. 

The food is not bad, with steak and a decent carver table. Much nicer than many Vegas buffets that are prob 2x the price, but they haven't been a good deal since prob the early 90s - I digress. I do like that buffet does not equal low quality all the time. 

So, I give the food a 4 or 4.5 stars, the location is about a 2 (second time back on the east side for me this week, pretty depressing :( at least the city is developing Eastgate some now and all the Superbowl money is helping develop 10 East) and a 1 for service based upon our particular server - left $1 for three of us.","Final ABSA Result:

Just had breakfast at Louie's for the first time and I'm sold. The never-resting-search-for-affordable-Chestnut-Hill-breakfast may have come to a temporary halt!

I had the pipeline and it was filling and delicious. The food was fresh, quick, simple, and tasty. There were a variety of menu options, but not so many that I felt overwhelmed. The staff was great. Very friendly and welcoming. The atmosphere was nice, bright, and comfortable.

If you come to Chestnut Hill, be sure to stop by this off-the-beaten-path spot. It's the best in the area.","[

902,"So i ubereats to this establishment and I've thoroughly enjoyed the food that I've ordered. Separate review but long story short... the delivery service thru U er eats was great but waaay too expensive. Unfortunately, if you want kore variety and choices for delivery places.. U ereats bears out DoorDash and others. So back to the review, i ordered their wings. I went with the Raspberry Jalapeños Bbq. I was intrigued and surprised a sports bar would make this type of flavor. Oh btw, if you didn't noticed... Whisky wings is basically Mug n jugs. They just changed the name awhile ago. The most unique wings I've ever had was at gator dockside.. there PB&J wings are AMAZING!! How do i compare the whisky ones to the PBJ??? Not even close lol. Its good. Ut not kind blowing like the ones at GD. The buffalo chicken dip was a surprised one to me. Its was smooth and creamy with the nice touch of buffalo sauce to the cream cheese on it. The chips were fine.. i mean come on, you cant screw that up right?!? I actually enjoy the dio more than the wings. I would say its better than your typical franchise sports bar that offer the buffalo dip. All in all, it would be better if i ate at the establishment but i was lazy and was why not ordered in!!

903,"In pursit of Vietnamese food in the Santa Barbara area, my Vietnamese friend and I hit up Saigon In and Out.  She grew up around Westminster so she knows pho.  I spent a month in Hanoi, so I could probably judge good pho too.

Location: Easy to miss on Milpas, keep an eye on the address.  Street parking in front and an odd dirt parking lot in back, look for signs.

Atmosphere:  Typical Vietnamese...clean, tables, chairs with rooster sauce etc.  There are some oddly placed large house plants.  Staff is friendly and attentive, no complaints.  Bathroom was clean.  

Food:  I've dined her many a time.  For pho: the broth is clean and flavorful and the meat is fresh, but sometimes lacking in quantity.  No excessive MSG like some places.  Nooodles are ok.  They don't have the usual brisket-flank-tripe combo but instead some type of meat balls.  I like tripe. The shrimp/lettuce rolls were good and fresh, but didn't seem authentically Vietnamese, but then again what is in the US?  Not for all but I like the corn pudding dessert.  

Prices:  SB...$8 for a bowl of pho.  

Bottom line:  #1 in SB area.  Better than Saigon Noodle, Saigon Express, and Asian Cafe.  If only it was closer to downtown or UCSB...

Their website is decent with a complete menu and prices.","```json

**Explanation and Reconcilation:**
1. **Aspect Term 'food':** All agents identified ""food"" in the sentence ""Food is meh."" The majority view was neutrality but there is a clear inclination toward a negative sentiment (Agents 2 and 3), therefore concluding negative with subtle intensity (-1).

2. **Aspect Term 'sauces':** There is variance in interpretation of categories between the two main groups of aspects: 
   - Some interpretations suggest 'service general' as the category (Agents 1 and 3).
   - Others mentioned 'food quality' (Agent 2).
   - Given the context, the service failure to include sauces seems most related to a service aspect.

3. **Opinion Term and Sentiment Polarity/intensity:**
   - For the phrase involving forgetting sauces, a negative sentiment dominates across all Agents with scores (-3) and (-4). Hence, a balanced moderate negative sentiment intensity of -3 is reasonable.
   
4. **'order to go' vs 'sauces':**
   - 'Order to go' was identified as a broader context by some agents (Agent 1, 2) but the core issue related specifically to not including ""sauces"", which was identified by Agent 2 and 3, appears to be more precise aspect under review vis-a-vis sentiment opinion extraction."

First off, we arrive and it smells of baby poo......someone just had changed their baby and it wafted through the place!  Not a good smell to start of your evening at a restaurant?!

Anyhow, my meal was rice and a chicken dish.....quite tasty:) However my friend did not fair well her quinoa salad was too vinegary or something didn't taste right and the soup was alright.  My friend had been there before and had the meal I had so it was not all lost!

The place is small and quaint the staff seem quite nice, but a little too pretentious for my liking.

Overall, I'd return if someone suggested it as it was quite tasty.....but I won't go out of my way as I like some delicious wine to go with meal:)","```

906,"Visiting a friend in Tampa and decided to visit, I had pretty high hopes for this place, it wasn't horrible but it's not awesome either.  The overall ambiance was nice and the server cool too.  We had:

The Cheese Board:  Cheeses were good, it was a very dry plate though; meaning it was very boring looking. It came with a small thing of honey and 5 almonds...thanks.   Also, if a table of 3 girls orders this app to share...we will need more than 5, super thin pieces of bread.  We asked for more bread and when they returned they gave us 5 more super thin pieces of bread...thanks again.  So we each got 1.5 bites and then had to wait 10 minutes to then eat another 1.5 bites.  We ended up eating plain chunks of cheese lol....They ""grill"" the bread...that's why it takes so long.  Once again, thanks for allowing me 3, 1 inch x 2.5 inches pieces of bread...please sir can I have another?

Burrata:  This was ok as well, not sure if anyone has ever had burrata, but when done right it's amazing!  This burrata was too tough on the outside, it was rubbery.  We didn't really eat it.

Tapenade: Not too bad I guess, once again, this quarter sized fried pieces of bread were given...is there a bread shortage in Tampa or something lol??

Rhubarb Tart:  It looked nice but wasn't executed right.  Rhubarb is tart and fresh, this ""filling"" reminded of the filling that used to come in those hostess pies at gas stations I used to get when I was 5 years old lol.  It was bland and felt greasy and oily.  The tart shell was overcooked and stale.  

Not the best restaurant, I get what they are trying to do with the creativity and all but the execution is just not there.  It's slightly off on flavor profiles and basic technique (buratta).","Final Integrated ABSA Result:
