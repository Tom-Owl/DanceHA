15,"I have heard sooo many good things about this place and was really looking forward to it. We got there at 2pm on a Saturday and there was STILL a long line, so I was pretty convinced this would really impress me.

I got the chorizo queso to start off with and it was absolutely delicious, so all good there. But then I got my tacos and was disappointed. The hot chicken taco tasted nothing like hot chicken and had a weird flavor. The adobo chicken had a very basic flavor to it, indistinguishable from the shredded chicken you find at any local Mexican restaurant. Both tortillas were hard in odd places.

Maybe I should've gotten something that wasn't chicken, I don't know. But based on what I had, I can't understand the hype behind this place. If you want something similar but better, I recommend hitting up Local Taco.","[

This place is amazing!! The employees are very nice, and the food is delicious. 
Very good locals hole-in-the-wall spot but if you are in the area defiantly give it a try Tinker's is one of the restaurants that Summerland is known for. Anytime you see locals flocking to the same spot over again that's how you know it's a real winner!
Does not disappoint if you are looking for a great burger and shake check it out and see how amazing it is for yourself!!!","[

32,"I wasn't sure when we stopped for lunch because it looked suspiciously like a chain and I didn't travel to NOLA for that, but it was sooo yummy. The food was tremendous and the service was great. I checked in on Yelp and was given the free appetizer. The gator bites had a slight heat, the burgers were tasty and the fries with beans and sour cream and chili were to die for. Overall a great experience although I understand the men's bathroom was kinda dirty. The women's was fine.","[

I ordered 1 Nutella, 1 maple bacon and 1 Oreo-all were delicious but my fiancé ate his at home so they had been out for some time and were a little dry.

All the food is great as well, I ordered the Sriracha sammie, my friend got the Popeyes rise n shiner Sammie w/ avocado-the bartender mentioned it's better that way and it was, and the fiancé got the pork chops, all were great.
I've also had their gigantic hot chocolate which is sooooo good...I clearly have a sweet tooth) and another item that's no longer on the menu, but it was good as well.

At our table we had a traditional, pulled pork & vegetarian poutine as well as a cheeseburger. Oh my goodness. They were all amazing, especially the pulled pork. We will definitely be back when we are within a 50 mile radius. The french fries were crispy, the gravy was savory and the cheese curds are spot on.

49,"Went there for lunch for the first time today with a couple ladies from the South City Girls Meetup Group. Service was terrific from the hostess, to the busser, to the server (Marcus). I had the Prosperity Club with sweet potato chips and they were sooo delicious! My companions had the beer cheese soup and the Hummus Three Ways. I will definitely recommend Alumni next time my workplace does a lunch out celebration. 

On a side note, I see in the reviews that dinner isn't as successful for people as it is for their lunch customers. Don't know why, different staff/managers, maybe? Plus, their person who comments on people's reviews needs to switch the comments up and also address the dissatisfied customers. It comes across as superficial otherwise. Just my thoughts as I was reading through.","[

60,"This place is by far the best if you're looking for a tasty burger that melts in your mouth. I ordered the 500 burger and added a side of wild boar bacon. The meat was so tender and it wasn't medium rare like I asked but somehow, it was still tender. There are many sauces to choose from such as sirracha and a house sauce( yogurt and horseradish) and spicy barbecue sauce.
 
I would have given this place 5 stars, but I was dissatisfied with the size of the restaurant. It's sooo tiny and on a crowded day you might have to eat outside!! But the biggest con were the Fries!!! They looked good but tasted greasy and as if they were old and reheated. I should have gotten the sweet potato fries. It's a good thing I brought home a side of sauce so I can dredge the fries in it!","[

65,"Had a date night here with the boyfriend on Friday.  Was originally looking to take him to the Irish Fionn McCool's, and realized that Fionn's had been replaced.  This Chatham is a HUGE step up from its Mass Ave counterpart.  Higher class clientele and the bar and service staff is a step up as well.  The hostess stand is a group of young high school aged gabbers, but hey, its what I did then too!
He had the heart stopper, a burger with a fried egg and 2 patties, He had to take it apart to eat and loved it!  I had the black and blue, cooked to order, tender and juicy, not a big fan of rasher bacon, but I really enjoyed it!
Jeff our server was very energetic and welcoming and gave his honest auggestions about what to and not to order by his recommendations!
Will go back, but not in a big rush to do so!!!","[

73,"First, this restaurant is a bit of a cross between a stop-in Chinese joint (numbered meals on the wall) and an American ""family restaurant"". There are a few tables and the waiter/cook will take your order and bring you food tableside. Ambiance is not exotic or impressive, however - the food is fresh and delish!
I had the chicken shawarma platter and picked rice and baba ganouj for the sides. The baba was very smooth and smoky - exactly what you would expect and you get a TON of chicken and rice (got two meals out if it) plus a large pita comes with the meal. I wanted grape leaves - they only do a full order - but they roll them there and they are delish - so it was worth it!
All in all, not fancy, but very yummy.  Mmmmm shawarma...","[

74,"Ordered delivery via GrubHub tonight.  Reasonable time for the distance.  At first glance we were a little underwhelmed by the presentation and size (I know, I know it's small plates) but it was more than filling once we dug in!  The Bulgogi Chicken was sooo good, I don't even like chicken but I stole quite a few bites from hubs.  Pad Thai was very good, maybe not the absolute best I've had but super enjoyable.  However, OMG the chicken dumplings ARE the best I've ever had.  Absolutely stuffed with chicken filling and perfectly cooked.  We cannot wait to dine in and try more food and the drinks!","[

This place is clean, like truly clean. The fountain machines always scare me, so I check. This one is super clean. Everything is fresh and the bread was sooooooo good today!!

91,This place is so good!!!!!! The service was amazing! A really nice lady came in and sat us down and asked if we'd been here before and gave us the run down and we made big bowls for each of us. The chefs were fun to watch and the secret is to load up your bowl with meat and noodles and tons of sauce like eight scoops and a few scoops of oil. Definitely recommend!,"[

When you walk in they are all sooooo sweet and happy. The food at the other tables  looked fresh and amazing. All we got was the waffle sundae, bacon, corn beef hash, tea and cocoa but everything was perfect! The strawberries were fresh and the corned beef hash was one of the best I've had.

Well goooood Lawd it was twice the amount of chicken I normally get in my take out I didn't even touch the rice. I enjoyed my piña colada and the won ton soup was the best I have ever had. 

I have enough chicken for two more meals from one $12 entree. My SO had left overs for an extra meal as well which is rare! So portions are huge! We agreed to share an entree next time we go.","[
