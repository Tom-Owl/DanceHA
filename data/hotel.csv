We had a nice view of the city and the river below, our room was spacious, clean, and the bed and pillows were sooo comfortable! Being attached to the Merchandise Mart was great because we could walk to coffee shops without having to go outside, and being able to walk to the metro through the Merchandise Mart was great!

We immediately went up to our room, which was upgraded for us and the room was impeccable, beautifully decorated, spacious, and spotless. We had some travel hiccups getting to Seattle, so we were starving (and ready for a cocktail) by the time we checked in. We headed down to the Library Bistro for a drink and a bite to eat. The kitchen was technically closed by the time we got down there, but the chef agreed to still allow us to get something off of the appetizer menu, which we greatly appreciated. We also loved the location-quick access to the waterfront and Pike's Place Market. We absolutely loved staying here and would definitely stay here again!!!","```json

3. **Group 3:**
   - ""location"" is agreed as the aspect term by all, with ""nice"" as the shared opinion term.
   - Positive sentiment and intensity score of 2 are consistent across analyses.
   - ""category"" is ""location general"".

### Explanation:
1. **Category Resolution**: 
    - The aspect term ""customer service"" was agreed upon by Agents 1 and 2, preferred over the term ""front desk"" used by Agent 3, and it is a more general representation of the service aspect.

2. **Opinion Term Resolution**:
    - Extracted terms from all agents for comprehensiveness.

3. **Sentiment Intensity Scores**:
    - For ""customer service"", the majority intensity score provided by Agents 1 and 2 was 4.
    - For ""Emily"", a consensus on positive sentiment was reached, with an intensity more aligned to score 4 due to consistent use of highly positive opinion (""splendid job"").
    - For ""hotel"", all agents agreed on a high positive score of 5, capturing the sentiment from both opinion terms."

13,The only thing good about this hotel is its close to everything. (like many other hotels around) It's way overpriced. The bed was rock hard. No fridge. U had to pay for wifi and after over $200/ night that should be free!!! The check in people were not experienced. I wouldn't stay here again. The paint is cracked in ceiling. It was clean which is very impt but way overpriced for this place. We had a great time but that is bc it was up to us and Boston is great.,"Final ABSA Results:

The beds are soooo comfy and the decore top notch paying attention to every little detail, nook, and cranny. For those saying that the rooms are tiny, they obviously didn't read about them before they booked. That's New York for you.

### Explanation:

1. **Staff**: All three agents agree on the aspect term ""staff"" with opinion ""more than impressed"", sentiment ""positive"", intensity ""4"", and category ""service general"".

2. **Accommodations**: Although there was a variation in the category (""rooms general"" by Agent 1 and ""rooms comfort"" by Agent 2), the prevailing consensus is in favor of ""rooms general."" The sentiment intensity of ""4"" is maintained due to strong agreement.

3. **Cleanliness**: All agents align perfectly on this aspect, agreeing on the term, opinion, sentiment, intensity, and category.

4. **Comfort**: Though there was some variance between the identification of terms ""stay"" and ""comfort"", the ultimate consensus leans towards ""stay"" with opinion ""felt like home"" and a sentiment intensity score favoring a moderate strength (3).

5. **Breakfast**: Consensus favored the term ""breakfast,"" with Agent 1's and Agent 2's agreement on the sentiment and intensity.

6. **Hotel Recommendation**: The broader impact and intention surrounding the recommendation justified the inclusion of both phrases indicating a strong endorsement of the hotel, aligning sentiment and intensity as reported by Agent 1 as ""hotel general"" rather than the varied assignment by Agent 2."

Let me tell you, the service at this location is non-existent, no room service, no valet or parking service, no respect from the staff at the hotel and when I addressed my issues with the hotel manager, she didn't want to speak to me face-to-face unless security was present. Scared of little old me??? Wow. Anyway, my experience at this hotel was not pleasant and I was inconvenienced by engineering multiple times and had to go off premise in order to get a meal. There buffet breakfast hours are from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. so don't plan to be in your room late because they will try to snatch it from you when you go to breakfast. Check out suppose to be at noon but the housekeepers discourage you staying until then with all of the noises they make at 7:00 a.m. waking up all of the guests. I stayed at better Hilton hotels than this particular one. Go elsewhere. Room wasn't cleaned properly either.","Based on the consensus from three different LLM agents' analyses, here's the consolidated conclusion for the Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) of the given text:

**Notes on Consolidation:**
- **Aspect Terms & Opinion Terms:** Most aspect and opinion terms coincide between agents, with some adjustments for clarity and consistency.
- **Sentiment Polarity & Intensity:** While sentiment polarity was consistent across agents, aspects with varying intensity scores were aligned by averaging or consensus, considering the context.
- **Category:** The categories were chosen based on the most logical fit for each aspect and consistent findings among agents."

24,"After spending our first night at the Hotel Pennsylvania, we knew we were in the right area of NYC but definitely in the WRONG hotel. After a quick search, we packed our bags and headed to the Radisson just a block away. The front desk management and staff were extremely accommodating and friendly. They had us setup with a room and even provided a complimentary breakfast coupon while we waited on our room to be cleaned.
Ahhh - the room. What a difference it made in our trip to have a room with clean new carpet, sleep number beds, nice tv's with a good selection of channels, soft bath towels, free wireless internet, and a staff that is ready to serve you at all areas of the hotel.
The location is perfect if your looking for great subway access, walking distance to Time Square...
I would absolutely recommend this hotel and plan on staying there on my next trip to NY.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

25,"seriously one of the best hotels I've stayed in. i'm a 20 year old girl who was traveling alone and I was sooo relieved when I arrived at this lovely establishment. the staff was very friendly, my room was super clean, and the location of this place could not be better!! it's a very short walk to the subway, multiple bus stops, and the famous cable car line. it's also near a lot of great shopping, the museum of modern art, and lots of places to eat. i felt very welcomed, cozy, and safe for the 3 nights i stayed here. I stayed in an economy room (a single room with a shared bath) and I was a little hesitant to share a bath but everything was always clean and i never had to wait to shower, etc.
I would definitely stay here again, without hesitation.","```json

**Explanation:**

- **Aspect Term:** For the ""clean room"" aspect, all agents have mentioned issues related to cleanliness. Therefore, a consensus was reached to use ""room"" and list out all opinion terms contributing to the cleanliness aspect.

- **Aspect Category:** Most agents agree on ""rooms cleanliness"". A unified conclusion reflects this.

- **Opinion Term:** Combined all opinion phrases that were mentioned related to ""room"" cleanliness: ""not clean"", ""mildew smell"", ""dirty bathroom"", ""used condom"", and ""broken coffee pot"".

- **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:** The sentiment intensity of -5 reflects the severe negative sentiment consensus across the reports about the room issues.

- **Service and Hotel Compensation:** There is an agreement on the positive sentiment regarding the ""vp of housekeeping"" as well as the hotel offering a ""free night's stay"", both reflecting fair customer service adjustments.

- **Neutral Feedback on Billing:** Both a neutral sentiment and score of 0 were agreed upon for the billing issue since it has been nearly resolved without major sentiment expressions."

The weather was horrible the whole time but at least we still had a great time, except for getting our car locked in the PMI parking garage because they are closed on Sundays and they don't tell you that before you park there and then when you go to leave on Sunday you find out that your really not leaving until Monday after 6 am! But luckily someone had a monthly pass to the parking garage and let us in and out and we didn't have to pay for parking, Saved us alot of money.

**Consolidation Notes:**
1. **Aspect Term and Sentiment Analysis:**

   - The sentiment intensity score for this aspect was consistently rated as 5 across agents, supporting the strong positive sentiment.

2. **Location Aspect:**
   - ""Location"" and its related sentiment were unanimously identified and rated highly (5) due to the specific phrase ""absolutely perfect.""

3. **Staff and Service:**
   - Combined insights on ""staff"" and individual names Ivana, Barbara, and Willie were consolidated to a single ""staff"" aspect. The opinion terms collected were comprehensive across all agents.
   - The sentiment intensity score was consistent among agents, consolidating to 4, reflecting a very strong positive experience but slightly less emphatic than the opinions on the hotel's overall quality and location.

4. **Categorical Consistency and Intensity Assignment:**

32,"This was one of the best hotels I've very stayed in. Everyone on the staff was extremely nice to me. I was at a conference at another hotel, so I was coming in late and tired. The staff made sure there were snacks left for me. They all gave me great recommendations for fun things to do around town, and treated me like a friend. The breakfast was fabulous, and the very kind man who ran it kept it stocked even when it was packed with hungry guests. My room was spotless, and the cleaning staff gave me refills on all my soaps every night. We called ahead to ask if they had a refrigerator in the room: Apparently they will in the future for all guests, but for that trip they actually put one in my room!!!! I used the indoor pool, which was conveniently open late, and just perfect for laps. This made my business trip feel like a luxury vacation!","```json

36,"I had the BEST experience at the Hilton Garden Inn - downton, which could have gone soooo negative. Accidentally locked my key clicker in the car. Valet Sean could not reopen the car with the key. He went out of his way to find a kit to get inside and unlock the vehicle and found the clicker underneath the seat.
IF it were not for Valet Sean, I may have had to spend $$$ for a locksmith and spend the night at the hotel.
Thank you SEAN for going above and beyond to help a hotel guest!!! You deserve a ""customer service"" award!!!!

**Explanation:**

1. **Hotel (Group 1):** All agents identified ""hotel"" as an aspect with a positive sentiment. The intensity score was predominantly strong at ""5,"" which is justified given the repeated use of emphatic expressions like ""awesome!!!"" and ""fun and unusual.""

2. **Location (Group 2):** Consistently recognized as a ""location general"" aspect with a ""great"" sentiment. The majority agreement puts the intensity score at ""4,"" indicating a strong positive impression.

3. **Free Hotel Driver (Group 3):** The aspect was expressed with ""free"" in a neutral sentiment context, aligning with ""service general."" While some discrepancies existed, the dominant opinion was neutral with the intensity score of ""0.""

4. **Hotel Lobby (Group 4):** The aspect ""hotel lobby"" was connected with gameplay, drawing some positive responses for being ""fun"" and ""unusual."" Based on agent consensus, this aspect fell under ""facilities miscellaneous"" with a positive but mild intensity score of ""2,"" aligning with Agent 2's perspective that reflects a pleasant experience."

**Consolidation Explanation:**

1. **Experience:** All three agents identified ""experience"" as positive with the opinion ""great,"" but they differed slightly on the intensity score. The final score was averaged out to 2.5 to reflect the general consensus.

2. **Location:** There was a discrepancy between whether ""location"" was positive (Agent 2 with ""near"") or neutral (Agent 1 and 3). Given the typical value of being near key locations in a city, a slight positive sentiment was given with a score of 1.

3. **Room:** There was consensus that ""soooooo big"" was a positive sentiment, but there was a category mismatch. The term ""rooms general"" was selected for being more encompassing, and the score was averaged between Agent 1 and Agent 3's assessments.

4. **Price:** The sentiment was mixed; however, the phrase ""free breakfast"" implies a slight positive rather than neutral sentiment. Incorporating the phrase ""free breakfast"" brings a slightly positive outlook with a score of 1.

5. **Facilities:** ""Old"" and ""not good enough"" were consistently marked as negative. ""Facilities quality"" was chosen as the most appropriate category because of the shared context with quality attributes.

6. **Future Intention:** There was agreement about neutral sentiment with no explicit negative or positive valuation in the actual text, though Agent 2's result suggests positive intent. The final result considers the neutral sentiment more in line with the text's assurance without overcommitment."

Explanation of the Consolidation:
- **Group 1:** The aspect term ""rate"" and opinion ""great rate"" were agreed upon by two agents, with a sentiment score of 2 aligning with more conservative scoring. The category ""hotel prices"" is clearly appropriate based on context.
- **Group 2:** A general sentiment about the property being ""very nice"" and ""well maintained"" matches the sentiment polarity across analyses. The category ""hotel general"" fits as it addresses overall impressions, with a balanced intensity score of 3.
- **Group 3:** While ""location"" is clearly described as convenient and ""near everything,"" multiple intensities were noted; 4 is chosen here for acknowledging the combined strong positive sentiment across analyses. The categorization was consistently agreed upon as ""location general.""
- **Group 4:** ""View"" with the sentiment polarity ""amazing!!!"" clearly reflects ""rooms design_features"" as the appropriate category. This sentiment and intensity had unanimous agreement among all agents at a score of 5."

48,"During our honeymoon road trip, we stayed at The Argonaut for one night on 9/19. The location is awesome, and we had no problem pulling up at peak time in the afternoon and having our car picked up by the valet. 
Our room was decorated in a nautical theme, and had a view of the park next door and of the trolley turnaround. We didn't make it to the wine tasting that evening, but it sounded like a nice feature.
Beds were great, bathroom was great, and the minibar offered playing cards and other trinkets in addition to just snacks. There was also a DVD player available and free internet service.
Our window opened up, so it was nice to get some fresh air and to hear the sounds of the street. 
There's a nice courtyard area with a couple of bars and restaurants right next door if you don't want to go far, and that park has a little beach with a great view of the Golden Gate Bridge.
I'm already looking for excuses to stay here again on our next vacation. Highly recommend!!!","```json

It is soooo quiet that you don't know the bustle of the D.C. is going on around you. There is a nice little store right around the corner that is the perfect place for great snacks when you want to skip your social events and park in front of the flat screen for the evening.

**Explanation of Conclusion:**

1. For the ""manager"" aspect, all agents recognize the positive sentiment expressed through phrases like ""out of her way"" and ""soooo grateful"" regarding Leah's assistance, with high consistency in the sentiment intensity, agreeing on the maximum positive score of 5.

2. Regarding the ""service,"" there is a consensus on the positive sentiment due to phrases like ""never been treated as well."" Agents 2 and 3 emphasize this as ""treatment"" or ""service quality,"" but here it's consolidated under ""service general"" with a strong intensity score of 5.

3. ""Customer service"" is identified in all analyses as positive, referenced by the term ""great"", with a typical positive sentiment intensity of 3.

4. The aspect of the ""hotel"" being ""nice, clean, and comfy"" consistently carries a positive sentiment with slightly varied intensity scores. Considering the overall tone and repetition, a moderately strong positive score of 4 is chosen.

5. All agents identify the aspect ""hotel"" with the opinion ""definitely recommend,"" advocating a positive sentiment. The intensity reflects a strong endorsement, consolidating at a score of 5. 

This output synthesizes the consensus and dominant themes from the agents' assessments, providing a coherent and weighted analysis based on their evaluations."

59,"We spent five days in NYC and stayed at the Park Lane hotel, which has the best location and view in NYC at a good value. It is steps away from the subway and walking distance of most tourist attractions. 
The property is a little old and could use improvments in the bathrooms, furniture, mattresses and doors (there is an aprox 3 inch space between the doors and the floor so you get to hear a lot of noise!). Some improvents in the cleanliness of the rooms would be welcome as well as a quieter housekeeping staff that seems to forget that most guests are on holiday and want to rest and not be awoken by their extremely loud chatter everyday. 
Most of the staff are very friendly and service oriented. All our requests were tended to readily and professionally. The first night we hardly got any sleep because the bed was sooo soft, but we called housekeeping and they took care of it right away.
All in all the pluses outrank the minuses of this property. We will go back in our next trip.","[

65,"My Husband and I stayed here for the labour day long weekend. We have been travelling to NY city for almost 17 years but it was our first time at Giraffe. We liked the location, close proximity to everything. It was recommended by our friends who also love staying there.
The hotel itself is small and staff very personable. They serve a continental breakfast, there's an evening turn down service, a roof top patio which we didn't use because we weren't arounding during happy hour. Our room was very spacious, king bed with an adjacent sitting room and a little fridge in the room which we loved. Nice spot to return to after a full day of activities and shopping in Manhattan to relax and enjoy a cold beer or a nice glass of wine before dinner.
No relation to the hotel but there a fabulous restaurant next door Los Caminos, the food is sooo good and a must try is the red sangria.
Will be staying at Hotel Giraffe again.","```json

69,"My friends and I all decided to stay here for a bday weekend 20+ people from LA and SF. I booked a ""Suite"" which while I will say the space big, there was nothing ""Sweet"" about it. The bed was uncomfortable, poor linen and towl quality, bathroom door fell off the hinges, modern decor cheap and tacky, used IKEA at best. The bathroom was disgusting, and overall the room was just not clean nor was it comfortable. WE BOOKED out of the hotel the next morning! By the way, the whole rooftop bar access is sooooo ridiculous. They give you wristbands at check-in, which if you dont have on, they wont let you up, even if you are a guest! I am glad we partied at the Figueroa, should have stayed at the WESTIN! Waste of $400!","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

Never the less my stay was wonderful and I will be staying there the next time I am in need of lodging and I will also recommend it to anyone else looking for lodging in the Fort Worth area!!!

72,"I stayed at this hotel for 2 nights before my move from Dubai to Chicago. It was the perfect place for my last two nights of living in Chicago. The location is fantastic...right next to the Grand stop on the Red Line, and just a couple of blocks from Michigan Ave. There are so many great restaurants surounding the hotel, including the Webber Grill, which is attached to the hotel.
Our room was very spacious and comfortable. Lots of great channels on the television, a coffeemaker, and a good hairdryer. All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, especially with the 7 pieces of luggage we brought for my big flight/move to Dubai.
So, if you want a stellar downtown location and great Hilton quality and service, book this hotel. We were SOOO pleased!","```json

The hotel is in a great location, 10 mins max walk to Time square and just off Lexington. 5th Avenue also about 5 - 10 mins dependent on your pace. BREAKFAST at the hotel toooo expensive but plenty of places to eat and can highly recommend ""LaBaguette"" on Lexington so just a short walk from the hotel and also Grand Central has a fab little cafe for breakfast and all at reasonable prices. Gym at the hotel is fine for a short stay and never very busy as my 19 year old son used this daily. I investigated lots of hotels and areas to stay but was glad I chose the Barclay,","Final ABSA Conclusion:

Explanation:
- For the ""1 Bedroom Suite,"" all agents identified it with a neutral sentiment, despite Agent 3 detecting a positive sentiment, the overall context and lack of a strong explicit opinion leads to a neutral conclusion.
- The ""extra room"" aspect was consistently associated with a positive sentiment across all agents, though varying on category ('rooms comfort' chosen due to context of comfort and fitting well).
- The ""location"" had unanimous positive sentiment from all agents with varying intensity scores; a medium-high intensity (3) reflects appreciation of the convenient location.
- The ""BREAKFAST"" aspect was perceived as negative due to repetitive mention of its expensiveness by two agents, settling on a sentiment matching Agents 2 and 3 with an intensity reflecting slight negativity.
- The ""Gym"" aspect's opinions suggested a neutral stance, averaging the evaluations to find ""facilities quality"" most fitting.
- For ""hotel choice,"" converging positive sentiments were maintained, with an intensity score that reflects the conclusive satisfaction in choice as evaluated by the agents."
75,"Our stay was absolutely delightful! They let us check in 4 hour earlier than check in time which was great. Unfortunately we didn't get the room with the harbor view but that was ok being that we were in the room so seldom. The staff always very kind, helpful and always had a smile. We really felt welcome. The lobby, pool area, fitness room and our room were very clean!!! Rooms are a nice size. We traveled with our kids, 13 & 8 years old and did not feel crammed. This hotel is convenient to everything! If ever in Baltimore again I would definitely stay in this hotel.","```json

The doors are not study and it was a crack so that you are able to see into the hallway-and if you can see you can hear believe me, I checked at least 11 doors.The pool was the worst!!!!! I looked and smell like sewage even if it did not you could not enjoy the lawn chairs everything was nasty.

85,"Staying at Public Chicago is really an experience that I would highly recommend to others. The design aesthetic is chic and elegantly simple. Beautifully detailed and not overly designed. There are all the modern touches, but somehow it still has retained a sense of warmth that makes you truly feel welcome and at home (in a good way). 
The staff were incredibly friendly, helpful and professional and they really made you feel like they were happy you were there. There are so many cool hotels, that have staff that make you feel like you are an unwelcome guest at their party, this was definitely not the case at Public. The common areas perhaps add to this welcoming feeling, the lobby, the library and restaurant were all very open and flowed into each other really nicely. 
I didn't eat there, but the design in the Pump Room was pretty awesome. While on the subject of food though, I loooooved the express room service concept, affordable and fast and the french toast was evil it was so good.
Neighborhood was beautiful, overall a really great way to spend some time in Chicago.","```json

Staff was great; especially Brian, the gentleman that brought our bags to our room and informed us of all the great places to go--beginning with the best food to be had a Reading Terminal Market, which is just across the street. There is a great little bar to the left of the lobby, in the hotel, that is friendly and busy, and they make wonderful white chocolate martinis! Everyone here was helpful and the hotel is quiet at night and in the mornings, if you can sleep in a bit--the beds are soooo comfortable; a cloud of soft sheets, down comforters and many pillows! If you are looking for good food, at a cool place, at a really decent price, call ahead and make a reservation at Bleu, in Rittenhouse Square. There is shopping and more restaurants even closer to the hotel , and a 7-11 convenience store right across from the entrance, for bringing snacks into your room. Will definitely stay here when we come to Philly again!","```json

The porters and concierge were lovely, helpful and didn't ask for or expect a tip once, although we did tip right at the end of the holiday. The receptionists were polite but a bit sullen and not over-friendly which was the only downside. We even got a daily $10 voucher each for a meal in the ajoining restaurant, Ferro's where we ate a lovely and reasonable priced lunch.

Explanation for Consolidated Result:
- For **Hotel Cleanliness**, the aspect term ""cleanliness"" was chosen based on a majority consensus among agents, with a consistently strong positive sentiment (intensity score: 5) indicated by terms like ""great"" and ""sooooo clean"".
- For **Rooms Comfort**, the aspect term ""A/C"" and associated sentiment were consistent among agents, with a slightly negative sentiment (intensity score: -2) due to sleeping discomfort.
- Added the **Hotel General** category capturing the overall positive ""4 1/2 stars"" sentiment as noted by Agent 2, reflecting a comprehensive evaluation of the experience despite the specific issue.
- For **Service General**, the analysis was uniform across agents, showing high satisfaction with the staff, hence, a positive sentiment with a score of 4 was assigned."

The hotel itself is lovely, the decor hardwood floors, concrete beams, very loft like, we had a corner room with floor to ceiling glass on both sides, awesome!!! 
The bathroom is great, i loved the rain-shower & the toiletries are off a very high standard. Service is good. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars is because one day after calling down for my car we waited 30 mins (They said the didn't get the message from the front desk) & at check out they added honor bar costs we didn't have. 
The Gym is very good, we tried to book the spa but it was full & we didn't eat her due to the fact that so may good choices are on your doorstep

106,"I stayed at the hotel for 5 nights in mid-March and was so disappointed with everything. The room was small, the carpets in the looby were smelly, no bathtub in the washroom and view of brick walls from the windows. Not even free internet which even the cheapest hotels offer these days. It costs $10/day to connect to internet. If you want to use internet in the lobby, minimum charge is $5 per use. To use the phone in the rooms for local calls, it is $1.25/15mins and then 10 cents every min. Even the local calls are charged, what a rip off!!! Every hotel I have stayed at offers free intercontinetal breakfast, of course no such thing at this hotel. No indoor pool, go figure.
I won this from bidding process at priceline, I will be reluctant to use this service and this hotel in future.","```json

There is a metro stop on the corner right by the hotel which was also very convienent. The rooms themselves were very spacious and comfortable.

### Reconciliation:
- **Aspect Terms and Categories:** A consensus was reached on most aspect terms and categories with minor variations in terms such as ""hotel"" vs. ""place"" in agents’ assessments. I standardized such variations based on majority consensus and appropriateness.
  
- **Opinions and Sentiment Scores:** The opinion terms and intensity scores were aligned based on commonalities across agents' results:
  - The term ""fun and safe"" was separated into its components because of variation among agents.
  - Scores were averaged or selected based on majority scoring where there was discrepancy.
  
- **Grouping and Structuring:** Aspect details were organized succinctly and labels refined for clarity and coherence."

115,"My daughter and I stayed in this hotel in April 2006. As we were travelling alone, safety was very important to us and we found the hotel to be in a very good, central location. The reception staff were very helpful with tourist information and buses etc. We had a double room and unlike most other US hotels we had stayed in, the room only had 1 queen size bed and the room was quite small. It was perfectly adequate though for the short amount of time we actually spent in the room and it was very clean. The free breakfast in the morning is good. The hotel is located about a 10 min walk away from the beginning of Fisherman's Wharf which is a great place to go both during the day time and early evening with street performers and artists. BUT beware of the Bush man!!!! We really enjoyed our stay in San Francisco and would definitely go back there and the hotel.","```json

We got room service one night and it was also very good :) The maids even made a point to come see us upon checkout to say thank you for coming. We were very impressed. Only thing lacking is a pool/hot tub. It was chilly and we would have loved to go relax in the pool, but its an older building and we knew it didn't have one going into it. Its literally next door to the Hancock Tower, and blocks away from the beach. We walked to Gino's East, and Jake Melnick's Corner Tap *YUM* Valet guys were nice, but we've had better. There was a younger guy who was our favorite - can't remember his name but he was great!!!","```json

4. The entry regarding ""restaurants and shops"" was primarily identified as neutral, fitting under ""facilities miscellaneous.""
   
5. The ""free parking"" was seen positively overall, despite mentions of constraints, with a balanced interpretation resulting in a moderate sentiment intensity score.
   
6. Staff and room assessments showed positive sentiment, meriting higher intensity scores due to ""wonderful"" staff and ""very spacious, clean"" room descriptions.
   
7. The pricing was highly appreciated, demonstrating consistent strong positive feedback and the highest sentiment intensity score due to perceived excellent value."

I was truly amazed how comfortable and quiet this hotel was. It took me a bit longer to get there but it was worth it. The front staff was helpful and friendly and other stafff members were also. There was a good variety of food for breakfast. There was plenty of parking which if you have stayed in LA and areas, parking is a issue. The room was clean and comfortable and I will say again, quiet. Don't pass this hotel up.","```json

130,"I like many people was a bit concerned about staying at this hotel after reading the many reviews. However, upon arrival our room was immediately upgraded to a junior suite - fantastic - it was huge. The room was clean and well looked after with coffee making facilities and a useful fridge if you wanted to keep your drinks cool. The air conditioning was a little noisy but I would rather have noisy air conditioning than no air conditioning - it was sooooo hot and humid in New York. They had a great Starbucks Coffee shop in the bar until 11.00am so you could get coffee (obviously) and a light breakfast which was really useful. The staff on the whole were very helpful and the concierge gave great advice when asked. The hotel was situated at 45th and Madison which was a great base for getting around the city. It was 2 minutes walk from Grand Central Station and 10-15 mins walk to Times Square. We would definitely recommend it and hope to stay there again.","```json

**Consolidation Explanation:**

- **Aspect Term and Sentiment Analysis**: Consistent aspect terms like ""credit card"", ""manager"", and ""statements"" were observed across agents, with some variation in opinion terms. The negative sentiment polarity was unanimous for payment-related complaints and manager availability, and neutral for statement checking. These sentiments are supported by the majority and intensity scores reflect severity.

- **Groupings and Categories**: Groupings were aligned where possible, particularly for the credit card-related aspects under hotel prices, and manager issues under service general. The ""incidentals"" aspect was presented distinctly due to a consensus on its treatment as a separate issue.

- **Opinion Terms**: A reconciliation of opinion terms was made to include a comprehensive list gathered from all agents, capturing the sentiment's essence presented in the user text."
132,"We had a great stay at the Hyatt Regency Hotel and Spa at Mission Bay! We had a total of three rooms. All of the rooms were not ready for us at the regular check-in time, however, they were extremely busy and were able to get us into two of the rooms right away. Alll rooms were upgraded to the newer tower rooms so we were OK with that! The facilities and grounds are immaculate. The pools were really nice. The staff were accomodating. We used the pool bar/grill, the gift shop and the Red Marlin restaurant and the Einstein Bagel Shop on site and had no problems whatsoever with anything. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this hotel to our friends and family. The location is awesome!","```json

135,"Joy the one who helps you book the rooms is excellent at her job and is more than just a person on the other line...check in was good we were early and they got us in by 2pm....then I got a text from chase that they put a 150 dollar hold on my debit card I think I should have been told at check in especially since it was a debit card....the room was awesome, really clean modern and fun. They even refreshed the room while we were out for dinner but the slamming if the door next to us by the help was unprofessional though I must note it was during the day and they did not start again til about 830am again.... The staff though were really nice and helpful but we came back to hotel for a drink and asked the bartender if he was still serving and then the night doorman came running after us and said no bar is closed and he was not nice at all no smiles no help no jokes and took care of traffic up the street better than hotel guests but the day doorman I think Felix was amazing and delightful. The only other issue now is my entire stay was credited and I have no charge so before work tomorrow I have to go to chase and find out what is going on....I would return because it was sooo clean and location and day time staff but I will book with third party like hotels.com and then give credit card for their 150 dollar hold since the billing is obviously screwy........But it was one of the nicest places in nyc","```json

**Consolidated Conclusion:**

1. For the ""service"" aspect, all agents consistently identified a positive sentiment with an intensity of 3 under the ""service general"" category. Thus, this aspect is deemed valid and accurate.

2. Regarding the ""view"" aspect, agents 2 and 3 classified it under ""location general"" with a sentiment score averaging around 5. The shifted sentiment intensity to 5 reflects the strong positive sentiment, accounting for the exclamatory nature of the sentence. My conclusion aligns with this perspective as the aspect overlaps significantly with location features.

3. The ""drinks"" aspect is universally recognized as positive in sentiment with high consistency from all agents at a maximal intensity score of 5, placing it under ""food_drinks quality.""

4. For ""entertainment,"" agents 1 and 3 agreed on it being categorized under ""facilities miscellaneous,"" with a consistent sentiment polarity and intensity score, which was slightly more substantial in agent 3's analysis.

5. The ""return"" or similar sentiments depicted in the text from agent 3 were consistently noted as positive in sentiment by agents 1 and 3. Despite agent 2's neutral depiction, the majority's agreement leans towards a positive sentiment in a ""hotel general"" context with a moderate intensity score of 2."

The rooms are clean and good size, bathrooms clean, but dated, and one AM with 5 ""girls"" getting ready we did blow a fuse by using 2 hair dryers(the front desk got it fixed in record time,must not have been the first time that happened). No hair dryers, no refrig, no coffee maker (free coffee and hot water 24/7 in front office). Walls were thin and it could be noisy from the other guests, and the street. The front desk people were outstanding and sooo friendly. They let some friends that had come to visit for the day park their cars without cost(twice).

138,"Stayed here for 5 nights early September 2011 with a group of friends celebrating 2 birthdays. The hotel is in a great location. Our room looked out on to not only the Hudson River from one window but Madison Square Garden and The Empire State Building from the other.
The room was spacious, clean and the beds ever soooo comfortable. 
Breakfast's at the Tik Tok Diner are a must. Great Irish Bar called Tir Na Nog only a block away.
Only down fall for me was the constant noise from the traffic on a night from the street below. But then it is a city that never sleeps so i guess you can expect that. But other then that would definitley recommend this hotel to anybody.","```json

The waterpark is awesome my kids loved being there and they have many pools & even a ping pong table. The only downside to this place is their food, it is very expensive and very discusting. We had the BBQ buffet at the oasis and It was all fat, we tried the oasis snack bar and our buffalo chicken wings where black inside like this chicken was beyond dirty!!! Their food is pricey and not good at all. I'd stick to the fast food outside the hotel instead of buying anything there. I don't think I'd return only because id like to explore other resorts , overall the kids had a blast and didn't complain about anything :)","```json

In this consolidated conclusion, I took into account the commonalities and differences in outputs from the three LLM agents. I noted discrepancies, particularly in the aspect terms and the sentiment intensity scores provided. I ensured consistent representation by selecting the most frequently occurring aspect terms and reviewing sentiment intensity scores for accuracy, adopting a middle-ground score when there was divergence. This synthesis yielded a comprehensive and unified ABSA result."

I stay at the property each year during a baseball trip. . . and Fenway Park is just around the corner. . but even if you weren't doing baseball, this hotel has the best of all possible worlds in a great location.
If I have one complaint and it is minor. .. food service is not particularly to my tastes. . why not just good food but efforts are made to modernize and make it trendy, which seems to distract what otherwise would be a great dining experience.

162,"I booked the St.Giles - Tuscany for the weekend of my husbands 40th birthday in which the entire weekend was a set up for a surprise party I planned at the nearby Lucky Strikes Manhattan. Upon checking in from the entry way & the sitting area to the orange infused water and the bubbly bell hop we were impressed. It takes a lot to impress my husband and I as we are both very meticulous about places we visit and stay. 
I informed the staff at the front desk that I was having a SURPRISE party for my husband the next day during the afternoon and they were very supportive, interested and GOOD at keeping a secret.
Some friends I had to fly in from Chicago to assist in the surprise stayed next door at the sister hotel St. Giles - Court and everything and everyone there was exceptional as well. I absolutely LOVE the hotel and we will indeed stay there again, we found tons of things to do in the area and more things are just a cab ride away.. Soooo much FUN!!","```json

163,"I was there for a long weekend getaway. The woman at the front desk upgraded us to a special deluxe room with water view. Let me tell you, the room was amazing!!! It was a corner room with floor to ceiling glass on two sides and we can view the harbor and the financial district and the galleria mall across the street. The view was absolutely stunning. The hotel is beautiful and classy and very close to everything within Inner Harbour. The only downside is the expensive parking but its expected since its such a classy hotel in the middle of a major city. Parking on the streets is hard so its worth the price. It was about $20 a day but I forget. Overall, the hotel is beautiful as there is nothing less expected from Hyatts.","[

164,"Stayed at the Sofitel Water Tower recently. Very nice hotel in excellent location.
Rooms were good size, service was fantastic.
If I had one small gripe though, it was that they charge for room internet access. Not overly expensive mind you ($10 per day from memory) but we found the majority of hotels we visited on this trip to the US had room wi-fi as complimentary.
Didn't deter from the overall stay....we plan to head back to Chicago in the future and this hotel will be top of our list. Can't wait to get back.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

**Consolidation Notes:**

1. For the first group, ""hotel"" was chosen as the aspect term over ""Sofitel Water Tower"" for consistency with the majority of agents, and it best fits the category ""hotel general"" rather than ""location general.""

2. ""Rooms"" and ""service"" aspect analyses were consistent across all agents, with no need for modification on sentiment polarity, intensity, or category.

3. The pricing aspect of ""room internet access"" saw differences in sentiment polarity. After review, the sentiment is best characterized as neutral with a slight negative indication, reflecting a more moderate sentiment score of -1 while remaining in the ""hotel prices"" category.

4. For the overall stay, the sentiment and categorizations are consistent across agents, with slight adjustments to reflect a consensus in opinion terms and sentiment intensity.

### Explanation:

1. **Staff as Service General**: All agents identified ""staff"" and agreed on the positive sentiment with a moderate intensity score of 4, categorized under ""service general.""

2. **Room Comments**: ""Room"" was consistently recognized with positive attributes such as ""comfy"" and ""modern,"" aligning under ""rooms comfort"" with an intensity score of 3.

3. **View/Restaurant Aspect**: The ""view"" was noted for its ""amazing"" quality. Agents diverged in categorization slightly (facilities general vs. facilities miscellaneous/location general), but the consensus on sentiment being positive with a strong intensity (4-5) gives us an aligned judgment under ""facilities miscellaneous.""

4. **Food and Service**: The reference to ""food"" and ""service"" as ""superb"" appeared across all agents, confirming strong positive sentiment with the highest intensity score of 5. The categories applied were consistent.

5. **Location and Recommendations**: Positive sentiment on location was consistently noted, focusing on accessibility, with a consensus on a score of 4 and the category ""location general.""

6. **Overall Hotel Experience**: There was a shared theme about the overall hotel experience. The agents acknowledge the hotel's recommendability and positioning, leading to a positive sentiment captured under ""hotel general."" 

Discrepancies in category labeling (like the view being categorized differently) have been harmonized by considering the strongest correlations between the outputs."

**Rationale:**

1. **Location General:** All three agents agree on the positive sentiment and aspect category. The intensity score from all three agents is consistently positive with a score of 2. This reflects a moderate positive sentiment towards the location.

2. **Service General:** All three agents consistently identify ""Nice staff"" as a positive aspect under ""service general."" The consensus is a positive polarity with a slight difference in intensity (1 vs 2), with two agents suggesting a score of 2. This decision errs on the positive with a higher intensity.

3. **Rooms Miscellaneous/Room General:** The recommendation to ask for a room away from the road is generally represented neutrally, concerned with preferences rather than sentiment. Agent 1 is an outlier with a negative sentiment. However, the riskiness of sound is implied, reconciling with the other agents' interpretations.

4. **Hotel Prices:** ""I paid a good bit..."" with reference to ""did not sleep"" introduces a cost issue aligned most clearly with ""hotel prices,"" capturing the sentiment of dissatisfaction with value for money. Sentiment classifiers pick up negative polarity and a moderate negative score, though the intensity varies marginally in context.

5. **Rooms Comfort (Noise):** Converging threads weave an understanding that noise from the road is an undesirable feature, thus all common findings pooled state a negative experience, with a robust negative intensity score. The room's noise is tagged under ""rooms comfort"" due to the impact on sleep quality.

6. **Rooms Design Features (Soundproofing):** The pointed inquiry about ""soundproofing"" is explicitly comingled with open dissatisfaction, assigning it as negative with an emphasis on lacking design features. Two agents mark it under ""rooms design_features,"" advocating its acknowledgment as a critical physical deficiency—laying it as a necessity (""soundproofing anyone?"").

The final resolution diligently weaves the combined evaluations, integrating coherent articulations and deviations into a collective synthesis."

**Explanation:**
- **Room:** All agents agree on the neutral sentiment for the room aspect regarding its location and lack of opinion terms, so it remains unchanged.
- **Noise:** With two agents identifying a significant noise issue, I consolidated the sentiment intensity to -3 as a middle ground between the identified scores.
- **Staff:** All agents presented similar negative sentiments. Opinion terms were combined for a comprehensive view, with sentiment intensity -4.
- **Overall Experience:** This aspect consistently appeared with the most negative sentiment intensity across all agents. Opinion terms and scores were synthesized for a final score of -5, indicating strong dissatisfaction.

**Rationale:**
- For group 1, all agents agree on the negative sentiment regarding the hotel aspect. The strongest opinion terms were pooled to reflect the deep dissatisfaction, settling on a strong negative intensity of -5.
- For group 2, there was consistent agreement among agents on the negative sentiment towards towels due to stains, and the intensity was agreed as -5.
- For group 3, all agents highlighted the cleaning staff issue, with similar sentiment and intensity scores at -4 due to sanitary concerns.
- For group 4, the perspective on pricing ranged from neutral to negative, with adjustments made towards a negative polarity and a moderate intensity of -3, given the context of dissatisfaction despite acknowledging the price being cheap."

193,"Took a chance attending a convention we'd never heard of and staying at the host (Blake) Hotel. The Hotel staff was very friendly and helpful. I forgot my toothbrush and planned on trying to locate a store in an unfamiliar town but when I mentioned this to the Front desk staff, I was given a new toothbrush at no charge. They had menus and recomendations for local restraunts that delivered. The rooms were nice and clean and the atmosphere was welcoming and made us feel secure. My only issues were the lack of soda choices at the snack bar and the incredibly sloooww elevators.
 All and all we had a good expeirence and plan on staying there again should the Monster Party return next year.","[

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1: Accommodations** - All agents identified ""accommodations"" with varying scores and slight category differences. The final category is ""hotel general"" (consensus), with ""above and beyond"" as the opinion term, reflecting the most positive sentiment observed, intensity score 5.

2. **Group 2: Staff and Management** - This combines entries related to staff and management, with strong opinions including ""wonderful"", ""courteous"", ""sooo much"", and ""memorable"", mostly agreed upon by agents. Given the uniformly positive sentiment, the intensity score is set to 5 for the category ""service general"".

3. **Group 3: Rooms** - ""Rooms"" was a common aspect with uniformly positive sentiment and consistent opinions across agents. ""Rooms general"" was settled upon as the category, with an intensity score of 4 reflecting the consistent moderate strength positive sentiment.

4. **Group 4: Bed** - Agents consistently identified ""bed"" as an aspect of comfort, resulting in ""rooms comfort"" as the category with opinion term ""comfy"". The sentiment intensity is moderate positive at 3.

5. **Group 5: Experience** - A consolidated aspect of the visitor experience, incorporating the niece's birthday trip and overall impression. Consistent sentiments on the aspects of location and overall experience are observed with positive sentiment, leading to a chosen category of ""location general"" and an intensity score of 4."

We left early in the morning to catch the clipper to victoria We had a great nights sleep on the super comfortable bed, a commanding view of the space needle, the TV was fantastic. Staff very helpful & super friendly. Everything sparkling clean, room service meal prompt warm & tasty. 
I pricelined another hotel in Seattle for the night when we came back from Victoria and I was dissapointed. Next time I will just make reservations directly with the Westin. My one night's stay there left me wanting to enjoy the facilities and the great location more.","```json

Then to find that the room we had booked had been given out because we had arrived late...........no suprise there we told them on our booking request, we just felt that the staff didnt care whether we stopped or not.

The main complaint is noise - it doesn't have double paned windows, and the street noise is out of control, even in my 15th floor room. A smaller complain is the suuuuper sloooow lifts.
Amenities wise, there's a lobby bar/restaurant. Didn't try them - this is NYC. There's also a pool, but I was there in October.
The location is OK - it's a long but manageable walk to times square, and not too far to a metro stop.

202,"This will be my third time staying in a Kimpton Hotel. My children ages 13 & 15 had never been to San Francisco so for a mini weekend getaway before school starts back we drove up from Los Angeles. The Prescott is 2 short blocks away from Union Square in the Heart of San Francisco and a few blocks from the Powell St/Hyde Cable Car, and of course wonderful shopping. We had a BLAST!! We stayed in a Junior Suite, arrived late Friday night and were so pleased to have the beds turned down with a welcome note and chocolates on the beds. The hotel is beautifully boutique in style and size and has lovely contemporary/classic furnishings throughout. Beds are incredibly cozy, (kids said even the pull out bed was comfortable), complimentary continental breakfast for Club Level members was nice on the 4th floor, and the staff is sooooooo nice and knowledgable. What I love is that it is close to everything. I have never had a bad stay at a Kimpton Hotel and I highly recommend your next trip to one of their locations!! Keep in mind that if you are looking for large rooms, boutique hotels may not be for you, however the suites are very nice in size and comfort!","```json

206,"Ok, this review is a little late. 
We stayed in March during our trip for the Architectural Digest. I'm an SPG Gold member so I try to stay at SPG hotels as much as possible. I'm also a bit of a germ freak and was thrilled to find out the Chatwal was bed bug free!!! 
The rooms are old world 1920's styled. Yes, they are a tad dark, and yes the room control can be difficult at times. HOWEVER, the bathroom is excellent, the bed is inviting, and the embrace makes you want a dirty martini on the rocks.
The location is great as well. I would recommend this to those looking for excellent service, great location, and attention to detail.","```json

207,"Our stay at this hotel was as travellers in transit heading to Syracuse. The staff went above and beyond to make our last night a memorable one. We opted to travel from Syracuse to Seattle as an affordable means to make it to Vancouver for the winter Olympics. The night we stayed at the hotel was the night of the Canada- USA hockey game (not the gold medal game but the first round game). We were able to watch the game with our family and the kids had a blast in the pool. When travelling in transit I am always frazzled trying to sort out the clothes, the tickets, what to keep on hand, etc. The staff made it very easy and with the helpful shuttle service added to our overall positive experience. In future we will consider doing the same trip in order to save on travel costs to Vancouver.

**Explanation:**

- For aspect 1 (staff/service): All agents agreed on the positive sentiment, high intensity score (5), and category as ""service general"". Consolidating this, the aspect term used by Agent 1 (""Hotel staff"") has been chosen as the final term.
  
- For aspect 2 (location): The majority of agents rated the sentiment as positive with a slight discrepancy in intensity. A middle intensity score of 2 has been chosen, reflecting Agent 2's inclusion of the phrase ""close to"", which adds further context.
  
- For aspect 3 (hotel): There was agreement on the sentiment and category among agents, with slight differences in intensity. An intensity score of 2 reflects the combined analyses.
  
- For aspect 4 (cleanliness and safety): Agents varied between categorizing based on ""cleanliness"" on its own or in a safety context. Combining these, the aspect term ""cleanliness and safety"" with a positive sentiment and an intensity score of 3 was used. This decision reflects the acknowledged cleanliness and the perceived safety despite some ambivalence, captured through the 'police all over' comment."

**Conclusion:**

- **Aspect Term:** While there was minor disagreement, the consolidated result respects predominant selections such as ""experience"" for the general hotel assessment, as well as ""room"" and ""walk-in shower"" for specific features.
- **Aspect Category:** The aspect categories are aligned with significant concurrence across agents. Issues between ""rooms comfort"" and ""rooms general"" are settled by judging the context, favoring ""rooms comfort"" for detailed aspects.
- **Opinion Term:** Where multiple opinion terms were suggested, both representative terms were included, like ""Too bad"" and ""sooooooo far"" illustrating the negative opinion on the location.
- **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:** The sentiment intensity scores are averaged if close, with stronger consensus favored, such as a sentiment intensity score of -4 for the strong negative sentiment about the location. 

The final integration ensures a balance of aspects represented by their contextual significance and strength of sentiment across different model perspectives."

For that price in NY I think it's really a great choice. 
Could be better: the reception is small and nearly always overcrowded, but they quickly attend your needs anyway, The desktop they provide id only one, but generally nobody is there (plus they provide a printer).

**Consolidation Explanation:**
1. **Aspect Term and Category**: Consistent identification of the aspect terms and categories across all agents facilitated a straightforward consolidation, with minor variations resolved by selecting the majority choice or the most contextually relevant category.

2. **Opinion Term**: Opinions were often consistent across agents. For instance, ""not disappointed"" was reliably attributed to 'Pan Pacific Seattle,' and ""fantastic"" to 'front desk.'

3. **Sentiment Polarity**: Agreement existed among all agents on the classification of sentiments as positive or neutral, with corresponding aspects appropriately noted.

4. **Sentiment Intensity Score**: The scores for most aspects converged well, thus confirmed the majority choices and context-specific scores. For example, ""Pan Pacific Seattle"" was averaged to a score of 2 for a moderate positive sentiment. For the ""front desk"" opinion of ""fantastic,"" a unanimous strong positive sentiment intensity of 5 was maintained."

we requested a room on a high floor and were rewarded with amaaaazing veiws of the city, with the chrysler building right in front of us. we were given such a massive room which even had a seperate lounge/office area which was great to come back to after a tiring day of shopping!
the location was perfect, within walking distance to the empire state, times square etc and the taxis are cheap enough for when you can't walk anymore!
the affinia was very clean, the staff were very polite and helpful and the barking dog next door is really good too. overall exceptional value for money.

240,"Me and my husband decided to take a last minute New Year's Eve Trip to Charlotte. I booked the hotel through Hotwire. When I saw where we were staying and I read the reviews here, I knew we were in trouble. I went anyway with the hope that maybe we got a bigger room and that maybe the walls wouldn't be so thin. Well, my hopes went unanswered because the room we had was sooooooo tiny that me and my husband could barely fit with our one suitcase. We were expecting to hear noise in the hall because it was New Year's Eve but the noise we heard ALL NIGHT long was from our neighbor and her lover. It was awarkard and we got no sleep. Please take my advice and don't let the name ""Crowne Plaza"" fool you; stay away from this hotel.

### Explanation:

1. **Fairmont**:
   - **Category**: Consensus from agents indicates either ""hotel general"" or ""location general"". Given the context of planning future visits and staying there, ""hotel general"" is more fitting.
   - **Opinion & Sentiment Intensity**: All three agents agree on ""positive"" with varying intensity. Averaging their scores gives us a 3 which fits moderate positive sentiment.

2. **Staff**:
   - **Category**: All agents agree on ""service general"".
   - **Aspect Term**: Two agents identify ""staff"" while one includes an extra ""f"", corrected to ""staff"".
   - **Opinion & Sentiment Intensity**: Agreement on ""positive"", with intensity scores from agents giving an average of 3 (rounded).

3. **Aria (Food/Drinks)**:
   - **Category**: Majority of agents agree on ""food_drinks quality"".
   - **Opinion & Sentiment Intensity**: Both ""Truly a dining delight"" and ""a winner"" are consistent across agents. The intensity has an average favoring a strong positive sentiment, resulting in a score of 4."

245,"Stayed at the Hilton Garden Inn for 5 days this February. The hotel is in a great area and is very close to the local shops, restaurants and other facilities. 
The hotel is pretty new and therefore is in an excellent condition. The room was excellent and the bed very comfortable. All the usual extras were included such as microwave, fridge, coffeee machine etc.
The staff were all very friendly and helpful and this added to the overall experience.
The hotel is about a 30/40 minute drive from the centre of SanDiego but you can drive 20 minutes to the fashion valley mall and catch the metro into town. The parking is free and the fare is $2 - $4 dollars (return) depending on your destination.
Overall an excellent hotel for a very reasonable rate.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

251,"Arrived in NY for the first time 6/2/04 for four nights and was looking forward to a great stay. I can say that NY was fantastic , but it's a same i can't say the same about the hotel Wolcott. Our room was on floor 8 and as soon as you managed to cram into the tiny lift and slowly make your way up (half an hour later), the doors open on to the most horrendous smell, so bad that it made you heave. Our room was so small and dingy, no natural light and the water pressure in the shower swung from freezing cold to scorching hot, the heating systems (i think) kept you awake half of the time and the heat in the room was unbearable, to say that we sleep with the window open and no radiators on!!! TThe hotel did provide clean bed linen and the towels were alway changed, which was a bonus. When the Tv didn't work we contact the reception desk to be greeted with very unpleasant staff, maybe the Wolcott could be given some training on customer service skills, this wouldn't go a miss.
All in all the Wolcott is a very cheap and cheerful hotel and as long as you ensure you are absolutely knackered and all you want is sleep then you could just about cope with this hotel. PS take a peg for your noise just incase your on floor eight!!!","```json

254,"I had no idea what to expect of the Biltmore but my god, did it go above and beyond my expectations. The building is simply stunning and is rich with old Hollywood history, this is where the Oscars started after all! The staff were incredible, the in house restaurants were great, the beds were comfy and the rooms clean. 
I have no idea why it doesn't sit on par with the Chateau Marmont, perhaps it's because of the slightly seedy downtown area, the Marmont is beautiful but having spent time in a couple of different rooms there they are really nothing too spectacular and very similar to some of the old apartment buildings in Hollywood.
Although downtown LA is still up and coming it really is getting there, just walk a block and a half from the Biltmore to Bottega Louie a fairly new upscale deli, restaurant and market, not only can you enjoy the food but it'll give you a glimpse of just where downtown is heading.
The only downfall- PARKING $45 a night!!! I beleive this is due to the fact they have very few parking spaces and don't actually want you to park there. There is a parking structure across the street for just $5 though.","```json

269,"My boyfriend and I stayed at the Omni Hotel California Plaza from 12/30/2011-1/2/2012, in addition to us celebrating the New Year, the 30th was his Birthday. We checked in late Friday evening after a long flight from Connecticut, we were greeted with excellent customer service, upgraded to a Premier Room upon check-in and a complementary glass of white wine after the front desk staff that assisted us saw how exhausted we were! As a woman who is finicky about everything imaginable, I was sooooo pleased with the cleanliness of this Hotel, the plastic that was placed daily on the wine glasses and drinking classes, I didn't feel like I had to wear shower shoes in the stand alone shower, which is huge for me, the bathroom excellent size, only drawback ladies not enough counter space. Room service was excellent, I have to say we experienced none of the issues the patron did with breakfast trays being left in the hallway, we ordered room service Saturday Night left the tray outside the door the next morning within the hour it was gone. I was impressed with the fitness Center, no issues there either, excellent equipment options, loved the basket of complementary brand new ear buds you could use, however I brought my own. I am back and forth from home to LA at least 3 times a year, so I agree Downtown LA isn't the best place for Restaurant options, I mean come on your in LA, venture out, We dined at Katana's Friday evening, we tried to make it to Fogo de Chao Saturday but had to get ready for New Year’s Eve Party, so ended up eating at the Grove, Sunday it was Bossanova excellent Brazilian food. Near by the Omni there is an Ice-skating ring and many areas to walk around to see during the DAY or early evening of Downtown LA. Last I am a Starbucks fanatic and when I attempted to grab a caffine jolt before my evening began Saturday I was told by the worker at the cafe' located in the hotel on the 2nd floor that the machines were being cleaned, they were suppose to close at 8pm, it was 7:40pm needless to say I was not a happy camper.","```json

274,The place needed a renovation 15 years ago. There is no a/c in the rooms. The showers were cold - hot- cold - cold - cold.

Explanation:

1. **Hotel General:**
   - Consensus on ""hotel"" being an aspect in ""hotel general"" with consistently positive sentiment, combining ""very nice"" and ""strongly recommend"". The intensity score is averaged to 4 for balance among the varied intensities reported.

2. **Service General:**
   - Agreement across agents on the aspect ""staff"" in ""service general"" with positive polarity, largely due to ""excellent"" and ""free of charge."" Here, intensity consistently falls at 4.

3. **Facilities Design Features:**
   - For ""bar's furniture,"" the analysis indicates neutrality in opinion. The category differs between ""facilities miscellaneous"" and ""design_features""; however, ""design_features"" is chosen due to multiple agent agreement.

4. **Food & Drinks Quality:**
   - ""Breakfast"" and its associated opinions align as positive among analyses, with an averaged intensity of 4, despite variations between agents.

5. **Rooms Comfort:**
   - ""Rooms"" have consistently positive sentiment with the specified opinions. The intensity of sentiment aggregates to 4. Conflicting aspect categorization between comfort and design features in showers was reconciled with rooms comfort, reflecting broader sentiment on hotel rooms.

6. **Location General:**
   - ""Location"" was finalized under ""location general"" with ""very near"" as a positive opinion term and consistent sentiment intensity at 2."

293,"Wow! What a stay! My husband and I stayed here to be able to celebrate my birthday in town without driving. It was a few blocks further from the market area that I wanted, but well worth the extra steps. EVERYONE at 1000 was awesome, from valet to concierge to front desk where we had a glass of bubbles at check-in. They knew it was my birthday and the valet even brought me a red rose :)
The room was gorgeous and comfy. Like everyone else, we loved the bathtub (it's perfect for 2) and I could have stayed in it all night just drinking champagne and listening to the Mood channel.
I look forward for another reason to spend a special night at the Hotel.
Thank you!!!","[

**Rationale:**

1. **Aspect Term Identification:** There is a consensus among the agents regarding the aspect terms ""hotels.com"" and ""receipt."" The primary concerns in the text relate to obtaining a receipt from hotels.com and the service related to this.

2. **Aspect Categories:** The associated category ""service general"" has been consistently applied and fits the context of the concerns raised about the hotel service concerning receipt issuance.

3. **Opinion Terms:** The consolidated opinion terms include repetitive emphasis like ""DO NOT use"" and ""unsuccessful,"" capturing the strong dissatisfaction with the service, particularly related to handling receipts and interactions with hotels.com.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity:**
   - For ""hotels.com,"" all agents identified the sentiment as negative due to the author’s warnings and dissatisfaction, with an intensity score of -5 reflecting strong negativity.
   - For ""receipt,"" the sentiment remains negative owing to the frustration with the receipt process, though slightly less intense at -3 due to a highlighted struggle rather than complete rejection.

This final consolidated analysis takes into account the agreement across agents while resolving minor differences in terms of sentiment intensity and the specific phrasing of opinion terms to reflect a thorough ABSA result."

304,"My husband planned a surprise trip to New York to celebrate my birthday and to help mark something off my Bucket List. The first part of the trip, we stayed at the Michelangelo for its convenience to the Gershwin Theater. The location is excellent. Our room was beautiful and SPACIOUS!!!! The towels were soooo soft and the bedding luxurious. I was disappointed in the coffee service but that's just my taste. Just plain croissants and no regular ole coffee. Also the maid turned the heat on when she cleaned the room which was probably an isolated incident. I plan to stay here on my return trip.","```json

They upgraded us at checkin to a corner king suite and wow what a gorgeous view of the space needle and peek a boo view of Lake Union. It was beautifully decorated, and the beds were sooo cozy!

We had a mother and kids on one side, laughing up a storm and music videos followed by business telephone conversations on the other. we're sure they could hear us too, which leaves something to be desired, we're sure.

Ideally located next to Madison Square Garden and Penn Station, a few blocks from Times Square, Empire State and Macy's.
Highlights this time were:
1) Walked across the Brooklyn bridge (great people watching!)
2) Eat at Lombardi's pizza in Little Italy... arrive hungry!
3) Wandered round Greenwich Village and eat at Magnolia bakery
4) Walked round most of Central Park in the sun
Although tough on your feet, I advise to walk everywhere as there is soooo much to take in!","```json

So no isolation between rooms, I could ear clearly what my neighbour was doing and I had to change room at midnight because the music was too lowed... 4 stars??? 
And I am not finished, I had too pay an extra fee to hold an extra shopping bag with my luggage, come on!! Seriously could we stop this ""fake"" hotel trend! Lucky we have Trip Advisor to help us to avoid these places. That's being said location is good but I went to Yotel which is a little bit further from time square but what a service and quality for almost the same price.

**Rationale for Consolidation:**

- **Aspect Term:** The term ""hotel"" was used instead of ""Muse"" or ""favorite hotel"" for clarity and consistency, but with the added context that the user declares it as their favorite hotel across locations, which is captured in the opinion term.
  
- **Sentiment Polarity & Intensity:** Generally took the most prominent or agreed-upon classification between agents. Positive aspects with consistently strong sentiment scores (≥4) across all agents were acknowledged, while varying opinions on the ""rooms"" aspect regarding size and cost were settled on a slight negative sentiment with confirmation by two agents.

- **Opinion Terms:** Aggregated from all agents for comprehensive coverage of sentiment expressions while ensuring less than five words per term when broken down.

- **Category:** Consistently used categories that were agreed upon by at least two agents; changes were made where clearly specified terms suggested a certain classification, maintaining alignment with predefined categories."

335,"This was my first trip to Denver from the East Coast and thanks to the Doubletree Denver my perception of Denver as a whole was excellent! Everyone we came into contact with at the hotel, from the Front Desk Agent to the Guest Service Manager, were all friendly and informative. The hotel itself was very well kept. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and of course the warm cookie upon check-in was a wonderful welcome after a long day of travel. In terms of location if you are looking to be closer to Downtown Denver or to the airport this might not be the hotel for you. You have to take a bus and then a metro into Denver proper. However, the public transportation in Denver is really great, so if you did decide to choose this hotel you are still pretty accessible to all the awesome things the city has to offer....and Denver is great. I would definitely stay here again!","```json

339,"From the moment you enter the lobby you know that this will not be an ordinary experience. I found the guest room to be well equipped for frequent travelers--plenty of electrical outlets on/near the desk AND the bed. Room well lit, but controllable to create a calming effect.
Bathroom is modern, in good working order with a really nice shower head (meant to check the brand/model so I could look for one for home!) and with plenty of vanity space to ""spread out"" all my 'stuff'.
Nice TV, but frustrating video menu/system--takes five minutes (a little exaggeration) each time you turn it on to get to regular broadcast stations. 
Small restaurant with a decent menu that is not irrationally priced like most chains. Staff was attentive, but at the same time saw that I was working while having lunch and did not seem upset at all that I occupied the table for over two hours! Meeting facilities are adequate--not luxurious but very functional.

**Rationale:**

1. **Group 1 - Hotel Sentiment:** There is a strong consensus among all agents on the sentiment towards the hotel. The aspect term is consistently identified as either ""hotel"" or ""stay,"" with the sentiment being positive. A sentiment intensity score of 4 was chosen as a reasonable middle ground reflecting this positive sentiment.

2. **Group 2 - Parking Prices Sentiment:** The complaint about parking prices is noted by all agents. The aspect term is identified as ""parking"" or ""parking prices,"" both of which are related to cost. The category ""hotel prices"" is chosen as the most accurate, with a sentiment intensity score of -2 to reflect moderate negativity.

3. **Group 3 - Parking Lots:** The actual parking situation (availability and cost) was perceived as neutral by the majority of agents, focusing on the phrasing ""2 and 3 dollars,"" which does not imply positive or negative sentiment. The category ""facilities general"" appropriately captures this.

4. **Group 4 - Future Stay:** There is unanimous agreement on the positive sentiment regarding the desire to stay again. With a strong emphasis (""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"") and consistent results from all agents, a score of 5 reflects this strong positive sentiment."

**Explanation:**
1. **Group 1:** All agents identified strong negative sentiment about the increased price of the hotel, previously considered budget-friendly. The adjustments reflect a consolidation of the aspect term to ""hotel costs"" for clarity.
2. **Group 2:** Consensus across agents identified dissatisfaction due to the increased price of the smallest room, which is now significantly higher. ""Smallest room price"" captures this aspect more clearly.
3. **Group 3:** Mention of room size and the negative connotation towards its smallness were noted by agents, grouped under ""rooms general.""
4. **Group 4:** Regarding the price of a double room, all agents noted it's high, and sentiments align towards a negative score.
5. **Group 5:** All agents agreed on the extreme pricing comparison, with intense negative sentiment captured effectively."

No bad Priceline experience. 
Great location. Directly across from Millineum Park. 
Catch the trolley with jump on jump off access.

As for the sketchy neighborhood, I also see why it was mentioned, however, we found it a very convenient location and not once did we feel unsafe. We took public transport the whole time we were there and even returned after midnight one evening. We were 4 people - 3 women and a 17 year old boy who were clearly tourists and not once did we feel uncomfortable in the neighborhood. It is well lit and we often saw officers about. The hotel itself is grand with beautiful common areas and a gorgeous pool/spa area. The beds were sooo soft and comfy, but firm for a beautiful night's sleep. I would recommend this place in a heartbeat and will stay there again if I ever return to LA. Speaking of downtown LA, it was clear to us that they've spent a lot of effort cleaning it up and it's really become a gorgeous city to explore so do yourself a favor and check it out while you're there, it no longer deserves a 'dumpy' reputation.","```json

### Explanation:

1. **Aspect Term & Category:**
   - The ""burger joint"" category was chosen as ""food_drinks miscellaneous"" based on the consensus that this was appropriate for the term.
   - The ""service"" aspect was consistent across agents and remains in the ""service general"" category.
   - The term ""waitress"" is highly associated with ""service general"" due to its role in delivering the service.
   - ""Experience"" is considered under ""service general"" as it ties back to the overall service delivery.

2. **Opinion Term & Sentiment Polarity:**
   - ""Fantastic"" is the agreed opinion term for the burger joint with clear positive sentiment.
   - The term ""better"" for service relative to food was maintained from two agents, emphasizing this comparison positively.
   - ""Soooo nice"" and ""efficient"" were consistently noted as positive opinions for the waitress’ performance.
   - ""Truly enhanced"" conveys a strong positive sentiment for the experience.

3. **Sentiment Intensity Score:**
   - ""Burger joint"" received a score of 4, reflecting a shared opinion between two agents and slightly hedging from Agent 1's strong 5 due to majority consensus.
   - The ""service"" sentiment score was averaged at 3, between the higher recommendation from Agent 2 and the lower from Agent 3.
   - ""Waitress"" consistently received strong positive sentiment, warranting a score of 5.
   - The experiential enhancement note via ""truly enhanced"" aligns closer with Agent 2's scoring at 4, representing a significant positive impact."
354,"6 of us from rural Michigan checked in on the 21st of September.

**Conclusion Explanation:**
1. **Aspect Term for Group 1:** The term ""credit card"" is unified across Agent 1 and 2, focusing on the financial aspect relating to the fee charged.
   - **Opinion Terms:** Consolidating the detailed expressions ""charged"" from Agent 1 and including the frustration with ""can not get the value back!!!!"", ensures the emotion and complaint intensity are captured.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** A score of -5 reflects the strongest negative sentiment as reported by Agents 1 and 3, considering both the charge and inability to retrieve the fee.

2. **Aspect Term for Group 2:** The term ""response"" is used consistently by Agents 1 and 2, referring to the failure of the service.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** A score of -3, balancing between the moderate to strong negative feedback recognized by all three agents.

3. The aspect ""customer name"" from Agent 3 is unnecessary as it does not pertain directly to service quality or financial issues, so it is omitted from the consolidated report."

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term and Category for General Experience:**  
   There was a consensus between agents on the sentiment being positive and the need to combine the experience and overall hotel sentiment aspects due to overlap. The final choice of ""hotel"" aspect term from Agent 3, representing the hotel's general experience as a whole, aligns with agents’ suggestions and overarches multiple facets, allowing for a unified representation.

2. **Aspect Term for Accommodation:**  
   Based on the majority from Agents 1 and 2, I chose ""accommodation availability"" since it directly links to the aspect's core purpose of accommodating additional guests. It fits within the ""hotel comfort"" category, reflecting the assurance and ease provided in this aspect.

3. **Aspect Term and Sentiment for Cleanliness:**  
   There is minor variance, with Agents 1 and 3 having the strongest input regarding cleanliness being spotless, marking it as ""ALWAYS very clean"" and ""Never a found spot."" This supports a strong positive sentiment, aligning well with the original sentiment category of ""hotel cleanliness.""

4. **Aspect Term and Sentiment for Breakfast Bar:**  
   Complete consensus was found among all agents both in terms of terminology ""breakfast bar"" and strong positive sentiment being ""the best!!"", maintaining a high-intensity score attributable to the excelling experience in the ""food_drinks quality"" category."
373,"We really enjoyed staying here and were so happy with the wonderful service. The free mini bar snacks are great for when you need a little bite to eat. The continental breakfast is convenient, not the most amazing food, it's all pretty sugary stuff besides the fruit, but good to get you started for the day. The location is great, about 2 min walk from Hollywood highlands (the major tourist spots in Hollywood). The staff are always ready and more than happy to assist on any way. The bed was sooooo comfortable, we slept so well! The rooms are a little dated and sort of smell like an old apartment, but they are spacious and clean and that's what counts! there is also a kitchenette, although we didn't use that. 
So summarize, this is a great place to stay if you want to feel welcome and taken care of!!","```json

378,"I really enjoyed my nice quiet and relaxed Thanksgiving at Crowne Plaza with my husband. The best part was the Sleep Number queen sized bed. I slept so good, now I want to buy one. We had a suite (online special for booking 3 days in advance with my Travel Agent) for $80.00 per night. Two plasma screen TVs and Wi-Fi. Since it was a holiday, most of the staff was off, but luckily we had dinner at my Mom's so we didn't need the restaurant. The hotel is a bit older, but it was clean (my biggest pet peeve). I would definitely stay here again for that price!!!","```json

379,"Got a great deal here in December with AAA's ""Free Breakfast"" promotion. Check In was efficient and quick. Our 7th floor room was situated in the corner with a view of H Street and 11th street. Our corner room was spacious and clean. There was some noise from the buses and police sirens but we live in NYC so it wasn't an issue for us.
 Tons of restaurants nearby at all different price levels. We walked to most of the museums.
If you have mobility issues, ask for a room closer to the elevator since the walk from the elevator bank (6 sets) is quite long given that this is an atrium style hotel.
The ""Metro Center"" Metro stop has an underground passageway into the Grand Hyatt which was ultra convenient since it was very cold. The Hotel's indoor parking garage was full the day we arrived so we parked in the lot across the street from the Hotel entrance (enter on 9th Street between ""H"" and ""I"" streets) for $20 for each 24-hour period.","```json

The pool area is lovely and water is heated too, there is a small bar and restaurant that looks cosy, but we preferred the room service so we could enjoy the apartment, the menu is the same. There is also a day spa on the premises but it seemed quite expensive and a hairdresser. The hotel is on Wiltshire Boulevard which is very long, but away from the main centre near Rodeo Drive, we travelled by taxi, it was totally fine and convenient for us.
There is bus stop out the front of the hotel as well if you don't like to travel by taxi, if you like walking there is a great shopping centre called Century City which takes about about 15 mins
by foot. We dined at a fantastic restaurant called Rock Sugar at Century City, you will also find two department stores a grocery store and lots of designer and fashion stores.
We will definitely stay here again if ever we get back to L.A!

Everyone was friendly and helpful. It was an entirely wonderful hotel.

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term, Sentiment Polarity, and Opinion Term:**
   - *Location*: All agents agree on ""location"" as the aspect term with the opinion ""couldn´t be better!!!"" and a positive sentiment. The intensity score leans towards the stronger scores given by Agents 1 and 3 (5).
   - *Rooms*: Consistency across agents for ""rooms"" as the aspect with ""ok"" as the opinion and a neutral sentiment. The intensity remains neutral as agreed upon by all agents (0).
   - *Staff*: All agents consistently identify ""staff"" with the opinion ""friendly!"" and positive sentiment. The intensity score is consistently agreed at 2.
   - *General Experience*: Varying aspect terms provided (""general experience"", ""choice"", ""experience""). The final consolidated term chosen is ""general experience,"" as it's broader and encompasses the overarching sentiment captured across different agent interpretations. The opinion ""Good choice!!"" maintains a positive sentiment with a moderate intensity score averaging 4.

2. **Aspect Category:**
   - Generally consistent across agents for each aspect term. For ""rooms,"" category is resolved to ""rooms general"" based on the majority and a more precise classification. 
   - Differences are resolved, and the most fitting and agreed-upon category are chosen: ""hotel general"" for the overall experience.

The reconciliation is aimed at reaching a consensus, taking into account the majority agreement and logical selection when faced with varied responses."
404,"I stayed for 5 days with a party of 3 others. On day 3 we received 2 towels but no other time during our stay did we get fresh linen. Stayed there because of the great location but on the second day upon returning to the hotel with my group, my pajama shirt was laid out on my bed with obvious semon on it!!!! upon returning home i noticed i only had 2 of the 6 pairs of underwear i had brought with me! As for the service we didn't have any. The beds were comfy but there is a bloody tampon under the bed on the east side of the room that remained there everyday we stayed. The elevators are TINY (3 normal sized people per elevator) and they are also used by cleaning staff so in the morning it's a wait game to get into one of the two elevators.

We had room service one evening and our food was brought promptly and still was piping hot. The stafff was friendly, attentive and very informed. The only negitive thing about this hotel would be it's location. While it is walking distance to 16th street, it is still rather out of the way.

407,We had a great time staying at the Westin for our first time in New York. The staff was pleasant and the room with the view was great! It was exactly what we booked! I LOVE the fact that they will let you check your bags before your room is ready if you arrive in New York early and on our last day they let us check them again after we checked out of our room because we did not leave the city till 8pm. This allowed us to see more of the city without lugging our luggage around. We also ordered room service and although it was a bit pricey(but most room service is) the food was GREAT!!!! Everything we ordered was cooked perfectly and delicious! The bed was also one of the best nights sleep ever! If you want a great priced hotel in Times Square I would choose the Westin again anyday!,"```json

There are many places to sit along with a coffee/bakery kiosk, a restaurant, and some gift shops. The staff in the lobby area was very friendly and accomodating. My room was nice - it was in a corner area so I think it was larger than other standard rooms. It did cost $15/day for wifi, so that was a little disappointing but I guess that's what you get at higher end hotels.

413,"We stayed at the Milford plaza this past week! It is a great location no doubt but that concludes the great things about this hotel. The lobby/ check in desk are all under construction and was so unorganized. This hotel claims to be modern/ contemporary but there is nothing modern about the elevators and it was pure ciaos! The only lobby bathroom was dirty and the door was broken, my friend had to hold the door for me. There wasn't even a sign stating that it was a bathroom we had to ask. I had a package delivered to the hotel that they lost since they had no organization, even the security guard said there was no organization. I would never recommend this hotel to anyone!!!!! Nor could you pay me to stay here, but if you don't care about any of those things the location was great and the broom closets they call rooms were actually clean.","```json

The views were spectacular. Everyone was completely helpful. We were complete novices in the big city and the staff was always helpful and friendly. After seeing some of the other hotels that I was considering choosing, I am sooooo glad that we chose this one. We chose the Dumont because of the reviews on this website and they were completely on target. Thanks for making my daughter's graduation trip so wonderful.","```json

Service: The staff were really friendly and advised on local area and transport
Room: Brilliant, it was HUGE! with a walk in wardrobe, we loved it. Yes the kitchen is from 1970 but that didn't matter as who eats in when you're staying in NY!!! (p.s. i'm not rich, its just there's soooo many places to eat!)
It would have been nice to get a room with a view of the roads instead of the air con system between the surrounding buildings. Also a general pointer about NY, I think I know why they call it the city that never sleeps; its because of the police and fire sirens that echos around NY 24/7. That's not saying its a rough place, we saw absolutely no sign of crime and every street has at least 1 police car!
I want to live in NY and would feel happy living out of the Buckingham Hotel as its so homely.","```json

The catering manager Eden is a blessing - our events were perfect till the last minute. She would anticipate our needs and proactively suggest various options until we found the perfect fit. We were treated with so much care, so much attention and everywhere we turned found only perfection. At the end of the day- when it was all over and we wanted to go sightseeing, they went out of their way to find us a rent-a-car after we were turned down by all airport rental places. This place works like a well organized bee hive - smooth, on time, as promised-just perfect. I would HIGHLY recommend it for any events and would definitely by all means return!!! Thank you Eden, Muhsie-thank you Sheraton!","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

424,"Absolutely loved the Four Seasons. Went to San Francisco just for the day, but ended up staying the night and wanted to stay at a popular hotel, since there are so many hotels we'd never heard of, we didn't want to take a chance. We expected excellent service, a great comfortable and CLEAN room from a 5 star hotel, and we got it all, the beds were very comfortable we didn't want to get up in the morning, so if you need to be somewhere early just be prepared to cancel your plans or just put them off for a while. The staff was sooo friendly, always opening the doors and greeting you, even at 2 in the morning! And even though we didn't drive a BMW or Mercedes like everyone else there they still treated us as if we did. Unfortunately the only bad part was that there were protestors outside, but it didn't stop us from getting the room, they were outstide of almost every hotel. We didn't get to check out the whole hotel since we stayed there on such short notice and for only a day but I imagine it was just as nice as the pictures show. Also, we stayed in a Deluxe room for $329 and got a corner room, it was great because we got 2 huge windows on the 14th floor, we couldn't see the whole city or anything, but we're not picky like all these other psychos that complain about every little thing, so we appreciated what we got and thought it was a nice view. Hope you choose to stay at the Four Seasons and get the same great service as we did!","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

**Final Consolidated Conclusion:**

- For **Group 1**, there is consensus among the agents that ""Kensington Park"" is the main aspect, with overwhelmingly positive sentiment expressed by terms like ""loyal return guest"" and ""couldn't recommend it more highly"". This matches all agents' output, leading to a score of 5 in the ""hotel general"" category.
  
- For **Group 2**, while the aspect term in some cases was ""ambiance,"" the sentiment analysis is consistently positive across agents. The opinions ""classy"", ""cozy"", ""perfectly located"", and ""sooooooo San Francisco"" are established, with an intensity score leaning towards 4, and I have assigned it to ""hotel comfort"" as per a general thematic match.

- For **Group 3**, again ""Kensington Park"" is the focus, described as ""little gem"" and ""home away from home"", culminating in a positive sentiment with a score of 5, consistently categorized under ""hotel general"" by all outputs. "

**Explanation:**

1. **Location Aspect:**
   - **Aspect Term:** ""location""
   - **Opinion Term:** All agents agree on the opinion terms ""Great"" and ""lots of character"".
   - **Sentiment Polarity:** Consistently classified as ""positive"" by all agents.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** Two agents assigned a score of 4, while one agent assigned a score of 3. Hence, I determined a score of 4 to reflect the majority and the consensus that reflects the positive sentiment adequately.
   - **Category:** Classified as ""location general"" by all agents.

2. **Staff Aspect:**
   - **Aspect Term:** ""staff""
   - **Opinion Term:** Consistently identified as ""wonderful!!!"".
   - **Sentiment Polarity:** Uniformly ""positive"" across all agents.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score:** All three agents assigned a score of 5, indicating strong positive sentiment. 
   - **Category:** Categorized as ""service general"" by every agent. 

By reconciling the findings from the three LLM agents, the final output reflects an integrative and comprehensive analysis of the aspect-sentiment terms."

434,"We stayed at the Sheraton Gateway twice in December 2009, self, wife, daughter and her boyfriend. We liked the bigger than usual rooms, comfortable beds (best anywhere!), convenience to and shuttle connection to LAX and the free broadband (in the lobby), Having a Starbucks on the premises was a bonus. Also, the valet parking was quick and reliable, if a bit expensive..... We couldn't get the in room broadband to work and the IT Help Desk (external to hotel) was on message, so no help!! So I asked the Desk to refund the four day broadband charge I had committed to and they said they did, after I returned home it appeared on my credit card!! Now they're not answering email!!

436,"We just returned from a four night stay at the Westin Time Square Feb.17th 2005. First, four days before we were set to arrive we were e-mailed about a room upgrade for another $35.00 a night we gladly accepted, we were already paying $269.00 a night. Upon arrival at 10:30 a.m. Thursday morning we asked about the upgraded room and we were told they had none available!!!!! When we got to our room is was soooo tiny I couldn't believe it. Unpacking was impossible since they only give you three drawers for your clothes. The bathroom was okay but the robe that they hung in the bathroom had a huge hole in it, so I placed the robe with the used towels the next morning only to find the same robe hanging up again that afternoon (YUK!) The final straw was a blood stain on the white duvet cover and it was put back on the bed instead of a clean one!!!!!! overall our vacation was great but I would certainly find a different hotel next time.","```json

**Clarifications and Reconciliation:**

1. **Aspect Term ""hotel"":** Consensus was reached by all agents; opinions include ""lovely hotel"" and ""great area.""
2. **Aspect Term ""location"":** Merged terms like ""walk everywhere"" and ""only mins away.""
3. **Aspect on ""food_drinks miscellaneous"" (restaurant):** Agents used ""restaurant"" or ""recommendation"" interchangeably. ""Thoroughly recommend"" was considered in relevant context.
4. **Aspect of ""room"":** Consolidated sentiments from comforts and cleanliness and acknowledged separate category for cleanliness.
5. **Aspect ""service"":** Only Agent 3 identified employee/service-related sentiment; incorporated due to significant explicit sentiment expression.

446,"Hmmm where shall i start? The first thing that really disappointed me was when we (my family) first arrived at the Bahia Hotel. We went to check in and our reservations were changed without us knowing about it. So we ended staying in a room that was very run down, the beds were very uncomfortable, the sofa was very old and the plumbing was very bad in the kitchen and bathroom. Second thing that disappointed me was the maid service. It took 2 or 3 pnone calls for them to bring towels to our room and when the maids came to ""clean"" our rooms (if thats what you call it) it never looked liked they cleaned the room at all, the bathroom was still dirty, carpet still had sand on it. It seemed the only thing they did was change the towels and make the beds.The third thing that I couldn't believe happened was when all my beach towels got stolen from my patio. I think with all the homeless people and party animals around the Bahia they should have some kind of security patrolling the area around the Bahia more often especially at night!

449,"while the exchange rate offers $2 to the pound this is luxury thats merely very very pricey rather than unaffordable so we splashed out and it was great.
We had the most basic room package with no food so can't comment on the food. The room was large spacious, bright, with a large flat TV and a good big bathroom with 2 basins.
Excellent tea and coffeee maker in a big wooden case by the door is very welcome after a hard day shopping and sightseing.
A tray of chocolates with a farewell message on the last night was a nice personal touch.
Great location near to Union Square shops, with cable car stop right outside and Chinatown round the corner.
Swimming pool and whirlpool spa were enjoyed by us daily and were never busy.
A later checkout at 1400 was readily agreed to without any hassle, unlike many hotels which strongly resist a request to stay beyond 12 and make you feel unwelcome.
Concierge was very helpful, as we asked him to find out if Armistead Maupin was doing a signing of his new book while we were there - he found out within minutes and sent up a map of the location and a newspaper article on him from the previous day. Top marks for speed and helpfulness","```json

Best part was the bed. HEAVENLY & sooo comfortable... and huge!
The shower head was also amazing!
Nice & quiet, good location. 
The hotel had a really cool ""zen"" theme which I really like & gave the place a serene feeling.
The doorstaff/porters were really nice & helpful.
I would recommend this hotel to either business travellers, or tourists that want a nice comfortable bed to flop into after a busy day sightseeing.","```json

456,"Having just returned from our first trip to New York, we felt we had to praise the Affinia 50 hotel. 
The hotel's location was first-class, with a good selection of restaurants close-by (try the Mexican on 2nd Ave - Zarella'a; and the diner a few doors up for a great breakfast). 
The room we were given was spacious, clean and well-appointed. The bed was sooooo comfortable! The staff in the hotel couldn't do enough for you - but weren't 'over the top', just friendly and helpful.
The subway was only a block away, and is an efficient system that gets you all around New York. 
For a great place for drinks, try the quirky Monkey bar at the Hotel Elysee (about 10 mins from the Affinia 50) or for a treat, the bar on the 23rd floor of The Peninsula Hotel - great views of the city!

**Explanation:**

- **Group 1:** All agents identified the pricing aspect as neutral, with the opinion term ""$100/night"", which is consistent across analyses.

- **Group 2:** Combining insights, I retained the nuanced opinions related to the room. There were both negative (nervous about room type guarantee) and positive (spectacular view) sentiments detected, justifying the overall positive sentiment with moderate intensity.

- **Group 3:** All three agents agreed on the positive sentiment towards staff, with very consistent opinion terms (""very friendly"", ""helpful"").

- **Group 4:** The positive anticipation of returning was captured by Agents 2 and 3, with intensity scores ranging from 4 to 5. Aligning with this, I've consolidated it to an intensity score of 4 under ""hotel general,"" reflecting a strong positive sentiment.

Across all aspects, opinions were mostly consistent, allowing for a clear consolidated output."

467,"We stayed here for 3 nights this week having chosen carefully from the reviews on this site, and it was perfect. I was dreading arriving and being disappointed with the room or noise etc, but it was absolutely ideal. It is justifiably in the top 10(ish) of most popular hotels.
The hotel could not be in a better location being minutes from Times Square, Bryant Park, Penn Station, Macy's, Grand Central and the Empire States Building.
The hotel is shoe-horned into a slim space betweeen two office blocks, but is incredibly well-kept and quiet. The staff were extremely polite and welcoming, the concierge was excellent, and the room was lovely. It is true that the bed was the comfiest I have ever known!
I can be quite critical, but cannot find a single fault with this hotel. If you are able to afford to pay about $300 per night, definitely stay here.
I am hoping to return to NY and will certainly be back at this hotel.","```json

**Explanation:**
In the final consolidated output, the results from all three LLM agents were harmonized as follows:
- The ""corner room"" aspect was identified by all agents, and the overall consensus was to categorize it under ""rooms design_features"" with a strong positive sentiment.
- The ""wine & cheese welcome"" was consistently recognized as ""complementry"" across agents, under ""food_drinks miscellaneous"" with a slight positive sentiment.
- The ""little bistro"" was uniformly recognized to have a positive sentiment related to ""food_drinks quality"".
- The negative sentiment related to ""internet connection"" and its poor quality was consistent, with slight variations in intensity; the most severe sentiment was chosen for the final output.
- The issue of the $10 internet charge was addressed by consolidating the sentiment under ""facilities quality"" for clarity, acknowledging the negative opinion about both the charge and the perceived value.
- The refund process was normalized as ""service general"" because it involved customer service aspects. The sentiment was universally negative, with a consistent intensity score across LLM outputs."

**Considerations:**

- The analysis primarily settles on ""room"" and ""location"" aspects, with consistent opinions and sentiments across the agents.
- I selected ""Westin Copley Place"" as the aspect for the sentence stating the hotel booking.
- The ""Front Desk"" services and the quick ""check-in process"" have positive sentiments, highlighted by terms like ""very polite, fast, efficient"", with similar contributions across agents, leading to the assessment of strong positive sentiment.
- ""Room upgrade"" was consolidated as an aspect offering moderate positivity, distinguished by the context of improvement or betterment.
- The ""experience"" overall was described in very positive terms, reflected by sentiments like ""the best weekend ever"".
- Opinions with high intensity such as ""room was perfect!!!"" and ""definitely recommend"" solidify the strength of the hotel's perception, accruing a strong positive sentiment. 

Adjustments were made to ensure no contradicted information was reported, using the most common outputs from the agents."

The rooms are like none other we've experienced in our travels.

488,"We loved our room! It was sooo cute, comfortable, and clean! The room and hotel was much better than I expected considering the low price and last minute reservation. We even got an upgrade to a deluxe king room with a view of the street and a late check out for free. The room wasn't big by any means, but the bathroom was very spacious. The flat screen tv and ipod dock was a nice touch too! The staff was also very helpful and gave personalized attention. We've stayed at chain hotels two and three times as expensive in nyc- yet this is one of my favorites. I will definitely be returning!","Final Consolidated ABSA Conclusion:

489,"We booked a double room at this hotel and we stayed for 4 nights. The check in was really quick and easy; they even let us check in a few hours earlier and the hotel staff were really helpful welcoming. In the lobby, the concierge desk was great as they helped us find attractions in New York and recommended places for us to visit. There were even some ipads for visitor use if we needed to search for some information on the internet. Our room was clean and was a perfect size. The location of the hotel was fantastic, it was just a minutes walk down to Times Square which was excellent. This meant the hotel was near to restaurants and shops, so it was very convenient for us. The prices for food in the hotel were quite expensive, but due to the location there were plenty of places to eat for breakfast and dinner nearby. If travelling to New York, I would highly recommend this hotel!!!","Here is the final, consolidated conclusion based on the results of the three LLM agents:

490,"I got to this hotel early April and i must say it was fantastic. Smallish room but no way as small as people had warned me about, so maybe it was generally big for Manhattan. Generally the hotel was super clean and well presented, all in all i can't really complain. The FREE bottled water, WIFI access and PC's with free printing was also fabulous to get all your documents like tickets etc printed. 
Finally i'd like to the add the staff was really good especially Christina (i think that was her name, usually on evening shifts) she was great help, always welcomed us with a Heyyy and a fab smile.
Overall i suggest you go here if you can as its great in all aspects and SOOOOO central we managed to go everywhere walking from our hotel!","```json

In this consolidated output, the results were harmonized based on the strengths of each agent's analysis. For instance, agreed terms like ""hotel"" for ""Cassa Hotel"" and ""staff"" for ""service"" were concatenated for clarity. Conflicting interpretations were reviewed for consistency based on majority decision and context. Aspect categorization was refined to ensure clarity and relevance across the entire dataset, such as differentiating between ""location"" and ""cleanliness"" aspects within the same sentence for better granularity."

The location is the main reason: walking distance to Central Park, Broadway, Fifth Avenue, Madison Avenue, Frick, etc. I only took a taxi ride twice during our stay. The rooms at the hotel are really nice: beds are perfect, amenities are sufficient, and the rooms quiet and clean. The staff at the Parker are intelligent, helpful and courteous.

the hotel is half a block wide and has 44 floors on 6 ave @ 53d street. 
the lobby is very big and the hotel has direct elevators to te floors and the wait isn't long, the cheak is very fast and efficiant and even there is a confrence there.
the rooms aren't big but much bigger then other hotel rooms in the city, from the windows you see the urban jungle of manhattan. i had a room in the 42nd floor and the view was amazing. 
the bathrooms are modern and have sunken sinks in marble tables, the batherooms are quite small.
we recived an upgrade to use the lounge which is on the 44th floor which had amazing views of central park and the empire state building.
with good breakfast and all day long hor'devoures
the hotel has a big fitness center and an indoor pool but i didn't have time ot use them.
the hotel isn't cheep but with good service and the fact that central park, times sq, the moma, radio city muisc hall, are 5 min from the hotel , it's worthwhile
Thank you hilton for an amazing stay!!!!","```json

The food was pretty good with a great choice of Asian. Plenty of variety for breakfast. Many restaurants in the area

The beds were great and it was awesome to have a kitchen. The pool/spa area was very well maintained and provided some much needed relaxation. The morning breakfast was hot and fresh and very convenient. Lastly, the staff could not have been friendlier. Every time we entered or left the hotel, we were greated.

We've never gone to a hotel where there was someone to open the front door for us or where the front desk hands you a plate with warm wet wash cloths to wipe your face and hands after your long trip to get there. Nice touch! The room was lovely (A King Suite-Wong Room). It had fresh whole fruit in a basket ready to eat, robes and slippers for each person and some special treats for use in the bathroom. The bed was soooo comfortable and we are a bit picky when it comes to hotel beds. The continental breakfast was just delicious and there was a great variety of foods and beverages to choose from that morning.

524,"The Hilton Inn at Penn is one of those hotels that think that $230 per night is not enough income, and charges extra for anything imaginable. Exhorbant telephone prices are a norm in hotels, and the Inn at Penn is no different. However, charging $10/day for internet access and charging by-the-minute and by the page for printing and faxing is waaay too much. Even parking was not included in room price, and I had to choose between $25/day valet parking or a $22/day parking garage several blocks away. The mini-bar automatically charges your account if anything moves inside, even if it's not used.
Combine these together and I could have stayed at a $40/night motel for rooms the same size (incl breakfast and wireless internet) and without dreading my every step.
My hotel stay was paid for by a third party, but next time I will specifically ask anyone inviting me not to book a Hilton.","Final ABSA Conclusion:

**Rationale:**

1. **Location Analysis:** All three agents agreed on the location being a positive aspect, with the opinion ""What more do you want?"" strongly indicative of satisfaction. The high sentiment intensity score is confirmed by the use of punctuation and repeated emphasis. Therefore, a score of 5 is deemed appropriate.

2. **Breakfast Analysis:** While there were differences in categorization and sentiment polarity between agents, the most substantial opinion is that ""eventually you eat"" and ""enjoy"" indicates a net positive sentiment despite initial difficulties. This ties back to opinions like ""a bit of a problem"", leading to a reconciliation favoring the positive sentiment and an intensity score of 2.

3. **Rooms Analysis:** Consensus was present on room comfort, and the repeated opinions of ""good"", ""confortable"", and ""clean"" confirm a positive sentiment. An intensity score of 3 aligns across agents' outputs and original sentiment capture.

4. **Elevator Analysis:** All agents agreed on a negative sentiment regarding the elevator issue, with phrases like ""took forever"" and ""only problem!!"" emphasizing the frustration. The intensity of -4 matches the negative sentiment strength observed in the agents' outputs."

The room itself is nicely appointed. The bed is so comfy that I passed out every night I lay down after a day of walking and sight seeing.
Tipping is essential as with any other touristy hotel.Nice view from the 5th floor deck for those sunset/sunrise photos.

532,We stayed at this hotel with our team for a softball tournament. Check in was quick and easy with a very helpfull staff. The 1st night our A/C did not cool properly but I called the front desk the next morning and it was fixed by the time we returned to our room that afternoon. There is a Denny's restaurant right next door so we walked there for breakfast in the mornings. There was security present in the parking lots at all times. Coming in from the ball park late Saturday night we needed to wash uniforms along with all the other teams staying there so there was a line waiting for the washers & dryers. I asked the front desk clerk if there were any options and she was sooo nice. She called the hotel next door and made arrangements for us to do our laundry there. Their guest laudry was empty so we were able to get in and get out. I would definately recommend staying here!,"```json

Explanation:
- The aspect ""Grant Grill"" was ultimately defined as positive based on a balance between Agent 2 (neutral) and Agent 3 (positive), opting for the slight positive sentiment due to the context of it being a ""special lunch celebration"".
- ""Alberto"" as an aspect term showed consistent positive sentiment across all agents, with minor variations in intensity scores. Agent 2 and 3 provided consistent sentiment descriptions which were combined with some selections from Agent 1.
- The ""lunch"" aspect combined opinions and sentiment scores, leaning more towards the more positive evaluations, considering the enthusiastic phrases such as ""YUM!!!"".
- ""Roasted chicken"" and ""pastrami sandwich"" remained neutral as all agents reflected neutral sentiment consistently for these dishes."

I have stayed at the New Yorker Hotel twice before - the first back in November 2008 and the second September 2010. (I am only writing this review as I never reviewed on Trip Advisor then)
The first time we was in a small box room, the decor was quite old.... The second time I upgraded us to a suite with a balcony. What a treat! We had two huge TVs, a balcony looking over the city and breakfast vouchers for the Tick Tock diner! 
It is right by Madison Square Garden and has great links to the subway (right next to it), you are only a couple of blocks from Macy's and only a 10 minute walk to Times Sq.

556,"My wife and I stayed at this hotel on our 3 night - NY city trip. The hotel's location is simply amazing. All the hotel employees we encountered were very prompt, very polite and willing to help out at all times. The room was very clean, cozy, tastefully decorated and large enough for both of us. We are definitely planning on staying at the hotel again when we go back to NY city.
Simply Excellent!!!!","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

Explanation:
- The aspect term ""location"" and its analysis were consistent across all agents; it is categorized under ""location general"" with a strong positive sentiment, hence a sentiment intensity score of 5.
- For the term ""employees,"" the consensus was a positive sentiment with intensity scores of 5 from two agents, and this was chosen along with category ""service general.""
- The aspect term ""room"" included slight variations. However, the consensus was a positive sentiment related to both comfort and general aspects; collectively, they align closer to ""rooms comfort"" with sentiments supported by all agents. Thus, a score of 5 is given based on the two agents' higher intensity and consistent opinion terms.
- The term ""hotel"" integrates the sentiment from the future stay intention and overall experience phrase ""Simply Excellent!!!!"" supporting a positive sentiment with a 5 intensity for ""hotel general,"" confirmed by the majority."

564,"Thank you, Magnolia Hotel staff for a very nice stay. LOOOOOVE the complimentary foods and drinks, it was difficult to stop to eat on a busy business trip. Best feature by far to be able to grab breakfast, a drink AND cookies at bedtime.
Didn't use fitness amenities, can't comment on that.
Elevators are not as bad as some reviews say but once I rode one up just to make sure I was on it when it started going down. Not a deal killer. (I think if the elevators bother you, I can guess you are probably a negative person in general!). 
Thank you.

**Consolidation Justification:**
- **Aspect Term & Sentiment Details:** 
  - For the ""staff"", all agents agreed on the positive sentiment; consolidated as ""positive"" with a consistent intensity score reflecting moderate praise.
  - For ""complimentary foods and drinks"", two agents considered ""food_drinks miscellaneous"" while one considered ""food_drinks quality"". Because the sentiment is highly positive related to quality (LOOOOOVE, Best feature), the category ""food_drinks quality"" is used. The intensity score is strongly positive (5).
  - For ""fitness amenities"", all agents agree it was not commented on, thus neutral sentiment.
  - For ""elevators"", agents are split between neutral and slight/moderate positive. Given the presence of neutral indications and the lack of strong positive evidence, we chose a neutral stance with zero intensity. 
- **Ignored Aspects:** The aspect ""negative person"" from Agent 2 is subjective speculation not reflective of the service, facilities, or hotel's review, hence omitted. Similarly, general gratitude from closing ""Thank you"" lacked specific evaluative content.

### Explanation:

1. **Hotel Prices**:
   - **Aspect Term**: I chose ""reservation"" as the aspect term since it was the most consistent across agents' results and aligns well with the text context. 
   - **Opinion Term**: Combined all generated opinions related to reservation and pricing from all agents. This includes 'without a reservation', '389.00!!!', 'forget it', and 'hmmmmm'.
   - **Sentiment Polarity**: Negative sentiment was consistent across all agents.
   - **Sentiment Intensity Score**: Adopted the score of -3 from Agents 1 and 2, indicating stronger negative emotions than the score of -2 suggested by Agent 2 alone.

2. **Rooms Comfort**:
   - **Aspect Term**: 'room' is noted as the consistent aspect term across agents 1, 2, and 3.
   - **Opinion Term**: Aggregated all the positive opinions from Agents 1, 2, and 3 as they are consistent: 'lovely', 'incredibly soft', 'exactly as pictured'.
   - **Sentiment Polarity** and **Intensity Score**: Positive sentiment with a score of 4 is consistently agreed upon by all agents, reflecting strong satisfaction with the room's comfort.

3. **Location General**:
   - **Aspect Term**: 'location' was consistent across agents.
   - **Opinion Term**: Opted for 'Only 1 block', as consistently noted by Agents 1, 3 in their results. Agent 2 provided additional context, but the core impression remains neutral with moderate satisfaction, hence an intensity of 0 aligning with most agents' outcomes.
   - **Sentiment Polarity** and **Intensity Score**: Chose neutral directly from Agents 1 and 3 due to their emphasis on locational information being factual rather than expressing strong sentiment.

In the process, I concisely identified and combined consistent outputs from each agent for final analysis harmony and pandemic contextuality alignment."

**Conclusion:** 

- For the aspect related to the ""hotel,"" the common grounds across the three agents point to combining both opinions concerning the ""stay"" and ""hotel"" under the unified aspect ""hotel"" in the ""hotel general"" category. The opinion terms ""wonderful"" and ""Highly recommend,"" along with the emphasis ""!!!,"" signify a strong positive sentiment. Considering the sentiment intensity scores across agents ranged from 3 to 5, I assigned an overall intensity score of 4 as a consensus.
  
- For the aspect ""staff,"" all agents consistently identified the same set of sentences, opinions, and sentiment indicating a strong positive sentiment. Therefore, I maintained the intensity score of 5 across outputs for its definitive positive reception."

579,"What a pleasant surprise.
I was extremely worried going to NYC for the first time, as I had read various reviews of hotels, and wasn't sure what to expect.
The Salisbury was great.
First of all - Location, Location, Location - couldn't ask for a better position - within walking distance to all the great places of Manhattan, including a stone throw away from central park, and very close to broadway and times square, time warner building and various subway stations.
Room was large, clean, with 2 queen size beds and spacious cupboards and nice bathroom with ample hot water (appears to be a problem at some other hotels).
Amneties in the room include: complimentary coffee and teas daily with coffee machine in room, also has small fridge, room safe, iron, laundry service, vending machines on the third floor. TV and aircon in perfect working order - but who really cares about tv in new york - toooo much to do.
You will not find a better bargain than their $3 breakfast available to guests - includes coffee, fruit juices, an assortment of bagels and cream cheese, eggs and a variety of pastries - danish, muffins etc - 
Its an old hotel, but with great service, low price, highly recommended. 
If you want to find something to gripe about, there is no view (or wasn't from our room) as we had a brick building opposite us, but who really cares - you will be out in the streets of NYC most of the time anyhow.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1**: Consistent across all agents. The aspect term ""hotel"" is associated with the opinion of ""love this hotel"" and ""especially for weekend getaways"", categorized under ""hotel general"" with a strong positive sentiment of 4.

2. **Group 2**: The main aspect identified by agents 1 and 2 as ""special packages"" with ""true bargain"" as the opinion term, under ""hotel prices"" category is selected. Despite agent 2 listing a negative sentiment for price as ""wouldn't stay anywhere"", the focus agrees more towards the special packages, scoring a positive sentiment of 3.

3. **Group 3**: All agents affirm positive reception of the staff, with opinions like ""extremely nice"", ""helpful"", and ""most inviting."" It resonates well under ""service general"" with sentiment intensity 5 for strong positivity.

4. **Group 4**: Consensus on ""rooms"" with the opinion ""fantastic!!!"", and all agents agreeing on the positive sentiment with a score of 5 under ""rooms general"".

5. **Group 5**: Recognized by all agents with ""hotel"" and both ""love this hotel"" and ""highly recommend"" as opinions, consistently under the ""hotel general"" category, the sentiment is again positive with a strong intensity score of 4. 

This synthesized conclusion effectively incorporates input from all three agents resulting in a balanced, comprehensive sentiment analysis."

We had a suite which was very spacious by New York hotel standards and was serviced several times daily - lovely bathroom, very comfortable king sized bed and a seperate sitting room and joy of joys windows which actually opened in all rooms!!

The hotel has a great manager's reception in the evening, and a full hot breakfast in the morning. We had a room there for a few nights during the week and into the weekend, and the guests changed from business travelers to more families on the weekend. WIth families, there was a lot more activity in the atrium/lobby and pool, which might not appeal to some.

I have been meaning to write a review on this hotel for a long time and have finally got round to it. Considering that this hotel is based in the centre of NYC, where everything happens, I'm astounded that the environmental health department haven't closed it DOWN!!! I'm disappointed that nothing has changed since 2007, when I stayed there! My visit was a night with bed bugs and I only realised that there was a problem the next morning when I had red spots all over my legs!!!

### Conclusion
To consolidate the findings from the three LLM agents:

1. **Hotel Overall Sentiment**:
   - All three agents recognized the sentiment toward the hotel as a whole aspect. Agents 1 and 3 noted extremely positive feedback with terms like ""Loved!!!!"" and scored the sentiment intensity at 5. We unanimously categorize it under 'hotel general'.

2. **Staff/Service Sentiment**:
   - For the sentiment related to staff or service, agents 1 and 2 identified the aspect as ""everyone"" and ""staff"" respectively, while agent 3 combined staff sentiment with the hotel aspect. Considering the descriptive sentiment phrases used (""very friendly, professional, and eager to please"") and its consistent positive interpretation across agents, we conclude a positive sentiment with an intensity score of 4, categorized under 'service general'. The term ""staff"" was chosen due to its precise reference to people providing service.

3. **Room Comfort/Noise**:
   - All agents acknowledged the concern about noise from the freeway as a negative sentiment. Agent 1 and 2 categorized this under 'rooms comfort', while agent 3 labeled it under 'location general' based on direction reference. The consolidated decision categorizes it under 'rooms comfort' because it is an immediate comfort issue noticed from room occupancy. An intensity score of -2 was suggested based on the repeated sentiment intensity across all agents."

The room was beautiful, the service was A+ and I wouldn't change a thing. 
The location was perfect. A short walk to the pier to the Market, the first Starbucks, etc. You won't go wrong.

616,"I love this Marriott for its location but also the awesome staff. This was my second time staying at the hotel and even better than my first two years ago. Upon arriving, my friend and I chatted with the woman who was checking us in. She mentioned the hotel wasn't very busy but would pick up over the weekend, and that she would be able to give us a room with two double beds instead of one king, which was great. After a couple more minutes of chit-chat we went to our room and realized-- WE GOT HOOKED UP!!! 
The room was huge by NY standards. There was plenty of space to walk around, a large closet and a nice-sized bathroom with a stand-alone shower and large tub with jets. The beds were super-comfy and had reading lights attached to the headboard. The view from the windows was cut off halfway down by the wall, but that wasn't a big deal since we weren't spending much time in the room anyway. I was a little sad to leave our room at the end of our stay, and though that rarely happens in the city with most rooms measuring the size of small closets, I have always had great luck with Marriott.","```json

I'm not saying Citrus isn't great - I just didn't eat there. The rooms are spacious and clean - ask for one facing inside as the street noise is pretty loud.

Afternoon free wine meet and greet for all guests is a great way to meet fellow travellers. But, it's the rooms that make your stay, they are soooo west coast seafront laid back style with bare brick and panelling - the building was the Del Monte warehouse in a former life. The hotel is walking distance from the famous pier 39 - The Eagle Cafe upper level for breakfast - just do it! it's so close to the cable cars they practically leave from the side door of the hotel.

**Explanation:**
- **Aspect Term and Category**: The terms and categories have been chosen based on majority rule from the agents' outputs. For overlapping terms, the more common phrasing was selected.
- **Opinion Terms**: Combined best choices from the agents to create a comprehensive insight.
- **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity**: As the majority sentiment is positive, with varying intensity scores, a mid-range score or logical average was applied for more controversial figures.

622,"I chose this hotel after finding a great deal on expedia and paid less than $100 per night. Considering the price- this was a great place to stay. The room was nice and clean. I had a seperate sitting room and bedroom- each was a bit on the small side but both were comfortable. The siting room had a large flat screen TV and the king size bed was soooooo comfortable. The service was great but the valet parking was a little pricey. 
The hotel is not exactly walking distance to the museums and monuments but it's not too far either. I often times grabbed a cab which only cost me a few dollars each way and saved me the trouble of looking for parking once I got where I was going. I have no complaints about the hotel itself but it borders the business district so there is not much open in the area at night.","```json

629,"My husband booked our first stay in New York as a 50th birthday surprise and the hotel delivered in almost every way. Just a couple of negatives. The receptionist said she would upgrade us but we only got what we had paid for!!! The room was excellent, the bed - well just 'heavenly' and the views from the 29th floor just amazing! My only other gripe is the huge charge for the internet and the fact that the business centre delivered a fax to our room 4 days after they received it!!! We never ate in the restaurant or drank in the bar due to the prices but there are plenty of places to eat and drink nearby so it really wasn't a problem. Perfect location too. If the hotel offer any good deals we will certainly be back here next time we visit New York!","Final Consolidated Conclusion:

633,"My husband and I have just returned from 6 days in this fab city, where we stayed at the mansfield. Having read some of the reviews on here we were a bit weary to say the least!! The moment we walked into the foyer we were put at ease, lovely comfy snug with a roaring fire, and free coffee and tea machine. The receptionist was so friendly and upgraded our room straight away, the room or should I say rooms were great and not what we were expecting, the bathroom was a little on the small side but clean and perfectly formed. My only critisism of the room was that there was no reall storage for clothes, a very small closet and no drawer space but apart from that it was great. Breakfast was basic but fresh and tasty, lots of pastrys and fruits aswell as toast and cereals, juice and coffee what more do you want for free!!! The location was excellent, slap bang in the middle of everything located on a lovely street with plenty of bars and restaurants. All in all fantastic.","Final ABSA Result:

In addition to the wonderful staff, the Manager's Reception each night was fabulous: free drinks and appetizers (excellent chips and salsa made at the hotel!) We had lunch at the cafe also and it was delicious; everything is made fresh there at the hotel. And let's not forget the made to order breakfast each morning....delicious!! 
The pool was hopping and there were a lot of kids laughing and playing, but when in your room, you can not hear the pool noise which is a definite plus. The pool area is very pretty, too, with plenty of tables, lounge chairs, and towels provided.

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term 'Location'**: All agents agreed on the aspect term ""location"" with a positive sentiment. Intensity scores varied slightly, so a moderate positive intensity score of 3 is assigned.

2. **Aspect Term 'Service'**: Consensus on positive sentiment concerning the front desk staff and overall service, with ""excellent service"", ""friendly"", and ""helpful"" cited as opinion terms. A score of 4 balances between the highest and slightly lower scores provided.

3. **Aspect Term 'Room'**: Agents agreed on positive sentiment for the room's comfort and quietness. Opinion terms are consistent, and an intensity score of 3 fits well between differing scores.

4. **Aspect Term 'Wifi'**: There was variation on category and intensity score for poor wifi availability; final consensus leans towards ""facilities miscellaneous"" given the broad aspect mentioned, with a balanced negative intensity of -2 reflecting mixed sentiments and input from agents."
643,"This is a very over rated Hotel. The rooms are a lot smaller than what they appear, beds are not very comfortable and every time you toss or turn you have to beware of the end table catching your eye. Yes, they did do a lot of remodeling, but in order to get their money for remodeling they have a lot of hidden fees such as $20.00 per day to park even though you're one of their guests. Not to mention when most hotels offer free continental breakfast you have to pay $9.00 per plate for cold, bland, and tasteless food. Save your money and go to either Lulu’s or Mi Tierra for breakfast. 
Not to mention that they must have a deal with the taxi cabs when we asked for a nice after hours bar or club they gave us names a club that cost over $40.00 per cab ride one way so beware!!!!!!!!!! Will never stay there again and do not recommend this hotel. The hotel I do recommend that are spacious and reasonable is Best Western Alamo Suites; we stayed due to having to leave for our San Antonio trip a day early to avoid severe weather.","```json

### Explanation:

1. **Group 1:** Consistently identified as ""hotel general"" across agents with negative polarity due to ""very over rated"" opinion, hence consolidated.

2. **Group 2:** The analysis consistently points out negative sentiment regarding rooms' comfort, including space and bed comfort, with similarly assigned intensity. Merged aspects as agents split certain phrases like ""beware of the end table.""

3. **Group 3:** All agents agree on ""hidden fees"" as the aspect with intense negative sentiment relating to ""hotel prices,"" thus confirmed.

4. **Group 4:** All agents regard ""breakfast"" as negative under ""food_drinks quality"" for similar reasons regarding food descriptiveness, aligning at an intensity of -4.

5. **Group 5:** Two interpretations concerning aspects of “Save your money” were noted—overwhelmingly this phrase has been seen as advice for alternatives, indicating a neutral opinion when contextually shifted from criticism.

6. **Group 6:** All analyses accept ""negative"" under ""service general"" given the intense “beware” advisement regarding taxi arrangements.

7. **Group 7:** Consistent across analyses with a firm negative sentiment against the stated hotel, with the strongest potential sentiment.

8. **Group 8:** Variation in category choice for the recommendation of Best Western Alamo Suites, but most analyses note ""positive"" with slight variance in intensity. That said, categorized under ""hotel general"" as it's a general recommendation rather than a competitor (location general)."
644,"Just returned from a truly fabulous stay at this Hilton property! It has a boutique hotel feel to it, which I loved.
Positives:
-Rooms are hip, modern, new and very clean
-The property is not huge, like the awful Hilton near Times Square, so I never had to deal with lines, elevator waits, an over-crowded lobby, etc.
-Beds are so clean, and comfortable – this was the best sleep I’ve had, next to my stay at the Andaz, last year in NYC
-Location is good, if you are looking to not be in the midtown area – great food and stores are in walking distance or a really quick cab ride (I was able to walk to Chelsea)
-Staff was helpful
-Great value! The nightly rate was $40 cheaper per night than the Hilton property in Times Square - and this place is sooo much nicer, newer, quieter and cleaner!
-So quiet - that is a HUGE plus for me!
Negatives:
-Because it isn’t a spralling hotel, there aren’t cabs lined up outside, if you are looking to grab a quick taxi. Im the mornings the bell desk was happy to hail cabs down though.","```json

646,"My wife and I had a great stay here. The location is great! Right on the riverwalk. We only stayed one night and didn't notice that there was a button on the elevator (the B or basement button)that took you straight down to the riverwalk. The meals and drinks that are included are a nice addition, but you are sooo close to so many restaurants that it's not necessary. For this reason I would probably stay somewhere else next time, but I have nothing to complain about. It's just that it kinda takes away from the riverwalk experience a little bit with all the nice restaurants within close walking distance, but that's just my opinion.

655,"for real. i came on july 13 (it's been less than 12 hours later) and i've moved to another hotel. i got there at 630. 
the check in clerk was realllllly rude and short with me. 
their printer did not work. 
their computer froze up. 
the room key given to me did not open the door b/c the door lock was broken
the next room i got wasn't ""newer"" by what i thought it would mean. 
the air conditioner vibrated really loudly and 
when someone flushed the toilet above me it made a horrendously loud sound that made me jump off the phone with my husband because i actually felt someone was in the room
the remote control was missing
the fridge was blowing hot air
and behind the fridge was newspaper and a plastic bottle
nail clippings were on the floor
and you could tell things hadn't been wiped down
i left by midnight b/c i couldn't sleep as the bed was LITERALLY VIBRATING from the A/C 
the toilet flushed by someone else made me even more rattled
and i just didn't feel safe
and while i told the rude clerk what was going on the general manager did nothing and just stood there
only upside
apparently i got checked out as if i'd never been there so no charge
thank goodness financially it will show i wasn't there but mentally, still stuck with it in my 
head :( 
will check financials in the next week to make sure i wasn't charged
not so much a good place at all","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Hotel General**: All agents agree on the positive sentiment for the aspect related to the hotel overall, with a sentiment intensity score ranging from 4 to 5. The consolidation emphasizes the enthusiasm by setting the score to 5, as all agents highlighted strong phrases like ""great"", ""definitely"", and ""Highly recommend"".

2. **Location General**: 
   - The sentiment regarding the location is positive according to two agents, with a focus on ""unbelievable"" views. The score is set at a robust 5 due to the striking description of the location.
   - The sentiment about the ""short walk"" to amenities varies slightly in intensity but is commonly categorized under 'location general.' A moderate positive sentiment intensity score of 2 is chosen, acknowledging access convenience without overwhelming emphasis.

3. **Rooms**: There is consensus on the rooms being ""newly renovated"" and ""absolutely gorgeous,"" with all agents giving a maximum sentiment intensity score of 5. While one agent classified it under 'rooms general', the other two placed it under 'rooms design_features', which is the chosen category to align with the detailed commentary on physical features.

This conclusion balances the observations from all agents to create a coherent and unified sentiment assessment across all mentioned aspects."

**Rationale:**

1. **Hotel Sentiment**: Recognizing ""hotel"" as an aspect term with sentiment ranging from neutral to strong positive based on the specific sentence context. The initial mention of staying since 2005 is generally factual, so it remains neutral. ""Everything is wonderful here"" leads to a strong positive sentiment for the overall hotel.

2. **Room Service**: Consistently regarded as neutral across agents since no opinion term is expressed.

3. **Hotel Cleanliness**: ""Clean"" and ""well appointed"" are consistently positive across agents, indicating a moderately strong sentiment.

4. **Price Sentiment**: The sentiment about the price being ""waaaay too high"" is negative, with a strong intensity. This is consistent among the agents.

5. **Room Comfort**: There's agreement on rooms providing ""great views"" and generally being positively described.

This final reconciliation integrates the consensus from the agents, choosing sentiment intensity scores that accurately reflect the combined evaluations."

1. **Aspect Term**:
   - For ""staying"" vs. ""experience"", the term ""staying"" is selected based on agent consensus and direct mention related to the sentence context.
   - ""staff"", ""building"", and ""view"" are used consistently across agents.

2. **Aspect Category**:
   - The ""hotel general"" category is selected for ""staying"" in line with the majority and context.
   - ""service general"" maintains strong agreement for ""staff"".
   - Although categories for ""building"" differ slightly, ""facilities miscellaneous"" is retained as it balances the architecture's historical aspect.
   - ""location general"" for ""view"" is chosen based on agent agreement and semantic appropriateness.

3. **Opinion Term**:
   - Consistent use and detailed preservation based on agent consensus.

4. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity**:
   - Predominantly positive polarity is agreed upon.
   - Intensity scores are consolidated based on majority agreements, with the slight compromise for ""building"": lowering to a moderate 3 instead of the higher scores for different aspects."
672,"Bear in mind that this hotel is being rennovated. Located in a set back area the rooms are clean and very functional. I found the staff very friendly and accomidating, they had me in a room before check in at three. Found that prices for food and snacks to be on par with all other chains. There is a gas station close that will rip you off!!! Close to Carmel and a perfect spot to stay if you want to go downtown Indy or just stay in the Carmel area. Can't say enough about it and wonder if people that review believe they are suppose to receive a five star experience at a three star hotel for a motel six price. One other major compliment is that this hotel host the service men and women of Our country. They keep them in this hotel the night before they leave for boot camp and beyond.

676,"Spent a pleasant weekend at the Hampton Inn. The staff were very friendly and helpful, the bed was really comfortable and the breakfast was above average. While there was no street noise, the heating unit was VERY noisy, despite ear plugs.
Can't beat the location - all of the main tourist attractions are within a 20 - 25 minute walk. The hotel is really close to the Reading Terminal Market which is well worth a visit. 
A number of reviewers have compalined about the homeless people - the trick is to avoid Race Street. At night your best bet is to walk along Walnut or Chestnut (wider, busier, bettter lit) then up 13th.
If you come by plane there is no need for a car - the train from the aiport runs every 30 minutes ($7 per person) and the Market Street East stop is around the corner from the hotel.","[

The room was amazing and the shower was great....it was large and had a waterfall faucet it was so relaxing. The only minor complaint is the lighting in the bathroom is very poor and needs to be brighter.
We stayed in the Loft room. Snacks, water and sodas in the mini bar were free!

680,"I would echo all the positives about this hotel, and would probably stay here again IF the price is OK. I paid $1250 for 4 nights in July and given the Location I was happy with That.
Rooms are small, I can only compare to Hilton Garden Inn a couple of blocks away, which had much bigger rooms and beds, where I stayed first time I visited, but this year the price was too high and I went for this place.
I used The limo service back to Newark, which was great and cost $102 including tips and tolls and suited us for a hassel free last day.
Breakfast nice as is free wine, noticed some guests seemed to 'over use', this service, seems they saw it as a money saving excercise rather than go out and eat which is a shame.
I think the hotel is best suited to couples, and the staff were all very friendly. 
My only concern was the lack of visible security, no one asked to seee any ID when we came in at night, which they certainly did at the Hilton last year before you were allowed on the elevator.

Firstly my husband arrived separately from a conference in the U.S. He was not allowed to check in as they didn't have his name on the booking (despite his name being on every booking form I had, as well as receipts from the hotel when checking out).He therefore had to wait 3 hrs, in the lobby whilst we arrived.
Our rooms, we had 2, were tiny, noisy and bright all night.
The staff were rude and arrogant, with attitude, they were so busy looking at themselves, they had no time to assist anyone. 
An extremely disapointing beginning to a 2 week family holiday. Fortunately we relocated to The London NY, which was far better value, and fabulous in every way.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

Though the weather was very cold out, it was very toasty and warm in my room! 
My room was very clean and bed was made every day. It wasn't facing on to the road so it was very quiet at night (except i was right by reception so could hear people coming in and out). The shared bathrooms were always spotless and i never had to wait to use one. My only niggle was slight draft in my room coming through the gap where the air con unit was set in the window, but thats it!!! (i just slept at the other end of the bed)
 It is a great location for a first timer to new york and really great quality and safe place to stay on a budget and i would stay there again!","```json

696,"A buddy and I were working the ""24 Hours of LeMons"" race at Charlotte Motor Speedway and needed a place to crash. Since I had Wyndham Rewards points I booked a room for Friday night so we didn't have to drive down at 0 dark 30 and he booked one for Saturday night. We were both pleasantly surprised at the friendliness of the receptionist when we checked in Friday. We were all joking as I filled out the paperwork.
The room wasn't anything special and if one of the grills being off the A/C unit offends you, pass this one by. But it was clean, the bed slept well and it was one of the quietest rooms I've stayed in in a long time. Evidently they put sound deadening in the wall when they built it because we heard a little noise from the hall but nothing through the walls.
When I checked out Saturday morning we asked if we could get the same room for Saturday night and the receptionist checked us in as we waited. Could not believe how little hassle we had.
The good: super friendly staff; good sound deadening; good beds
The not so good: towels were worn out; no internet (I had a full WiFi signal but no connection however it was late and we were tired so I didn't call the desk)
The totally unexpected: the steak house across the street has a wonderful breakfast and they are open Sunday morning!!!","```json

704,"The place is lovely, but the service is really just getting underway - case in point - the Starbucks ran out of coffee!!! During my conference my entire table didn't get a lunch plate - the server said 'oops' and walked away.
But, ALL that melted away once everybody found the pool - it was perfect. 86 degrees year round - lots of space an amenities and a great poolside staff. Loved the lazy river and the zero-depth pool that stayed shallow enough for my kids to play in all day.
Rooms are average but nice - not sure who decided there should be longhorn artwork in every room... that's a little creepy. 
Make sure to visit the sports bar with the giant wall of 50 foot tvs.
Location: a solid $50 cab ride from the Riverwalk - not a plus. But a lovely view of the hills in all directions from the resort.","[

Showers, Beds, Rooms, Elevators, all top notch ( I say elevators because of past frustration with elevators at the nearby Marriott Marquis ). Always willing to accommodate and help. As a Marriott Gold Member, I received free continental-ish breakfast (did have eggs and sausage as well) on weekdays.

The bar Basque with Tatum Greenblatt on Wed night playing trumpet was such a New York experience. We were there for the New York wine and food festival and stayed for 6 nights.
I have stayed at other New York hotels that were more money, but not as quiet and friendly.

**Reasoning:**

1. **Hotel Valencia:** Maintained as ""neutral"" due to conflicting interpretations. While one LLM agent considered it positive due to the ""brief reunion,"" the majority kept it neutral. The sentiment intensity was thus retained at 0.

2. **Customer Service/Reservation Process/Representative:** Combined into ""customer service"" with a positive sentiment. Notions of helpfulness such as ""provided tips,"" ""enhance,"" and ""chatted"" were emphasized consistently. The consensus intensity score was 2.

3. **Room Service/Breakfast:** Consistently identified as negative in terms of the ""cold breakfast."" All agents aligned here, so the negative sentiment and intensity of -2 were reaffirmed regarding food quality.

4. **Noise/Club/Bar Music:** Divergent interpretations led to retaining neutrality with respect to ""club/bar."" Although there was one negative scoring, overall interpretations suggested a neutral categorization appropriate for ""facilities miscellaneous.""

5. **Overall Experience:** Positive sentiment was affirmed in multiple outputs regarding ""really enjoyed."" The intensity reflects a consolidated sentiment leaning towards strong positivity with a score of 3 for ""hotel general.""

6. **Customer Service (Great):** Universally strong positive with ""great!!!"" associated with a maximum intensity score of 5.

The final report ensures alignment and balance across inputs while asserting consolidated judgment based on the recurring consensus and strength of expressions."

The sentiment is positive across the board with opinions such as ""thank"", ""great work"", ""Many thanks"" and ""look forward."" An intensity score of 4 was selected as an average assessment matching the moderate to strong positive sentiment from agents.

727,"We were booked to stay here 9-13 November 2011 and it was amazing. Rooms were very comfortable and clean - as we would expect. The beds have to be the most comfortable we have ever experienced in a hotel. Our room was by the lifts on the 15th floor (not that we heard them) and although we didn't have a view this did not spoil our stay. The service was superb and the food choice for breakfast was unbeliveable. Prices were as expected for a hotel of this calibre although we didn't touch the mini bar as felt this was quite pricey!! Well placed to explore this fabulous city and we were very lucky with the weather.
Would we stay here again? - you bet we would!!!","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

It is so comfortable, so quiet, and yet still so close to the Riverwalk hot spots.
Some hotels that ""try"" to give great service it comes off as fake but for the staff of the Contessa it really seems as if they care that you are having an outstanding stay ....
Do yourself a favor and visit this hotel....... I see where it would be perfect for a romantic get away yet functional for a business meeting ...","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

729,"My boyfriend and i spent 5 days at the Roosevelt and we thoroughly enjoyed it. The location was perfect The room size was ok to us we didn't have anything to complain about. The room was always clean and the sheets fresh and crisp. The bathroom was also clean and whilst small it was just fine for the both of us. May i just add that the bed was soooo comfortable we proceeded to change our bed as soon as we came back from our holiday as we could no longer bear the thought of sleeping on a less than the Roosevelt standard type of bed i could write a whole lot about the bed... The tv was nice there was a wide range of tv shows, movies, news on tv. The hotel food was nice though a little expensive i would definitely recommend the Roosevelt hotel to my family and friends in fact next time i'm in NYC i'll probably go back there.","```json

730,"We had booked at the last minute (pending storm changed our plans on the Cape) and got a great price on Expedia. Wonderful room, service was exceptional but no real view of the water (I'm guessing the Expedia price). The staff was extremely friendly, told us where to go and the quickest way to get there. We're used to walking so we stayed away from public transportation - the last day we were there we broke down and took a cab back because it was toooooooo hot! 
Valet pricing is pricey - $42 a day.
Recommend the Birch Bar - great music, quiet and good food. 
Also, we had one wonderful dinner at Sorellina - it's across from the Westin Copley Place and it was AMAZING. The service was impeccable and we're still sighing remembering how delicious the food was.","```json

**Conclusion and Justification:**
- **Hotel General (group_id: 1):** All agents consistently identified this aspect term with a very strong positive sentiment reinforced by consistent opinion terms across agents. The intensity score is universally high (5).
  
- **Location General (group_id: 2):** All agents agree on the aspect term, opinion term, and intensity, resulting in a collective decision of a high intensity score of 5.
  
- **Rooms Comfort (group_id: 3 and group_id: 6):** Consensus was found among the agents for high comfort, particularly with ""amazingly quiet"" and ""great comfy"", setting a positive sentiment intensity. Group 6 supports additional context on beds, which is also consolidated under rooms.

- **Service General (group_id: 4):** There is consensus on ""Great staff"" across outputs and supportive sentiment. The intensity is averaged from agent scores (mainly 3 and 4), resulting in a 4.

- **Food_drinks Quality (group_id: 5):** Pasta was repeatedly highlighted for its exceptional quality. The sentiment intensity remains very high, averaged as 5.

- **Food_drinks Miscellaneous (group_id: 7):** Additional context from Agent 3 viewed the restaurant sentiment positively as part of the food/drinks experience.

- **Service General (group_id: 8):** Divergence on room service context was included, with the opinion term being positive and scoring a 5, notable for excellent service in this category.

This deduction builds a consolidated and robust ABSA result, factoring all participating agents' noted contributions and disagreements reconciled to reflect the most consistent and reliable sentiments."

I had a one bedroom apartment, not just a room, it was great, I only wish I had been staying longer to be able to take advantage of the spacious living room and fully equipped kitchen...the bathroom was great, the bed was sooooooo comfortable - there was an LCD tv in the bedroom and the livingroom - there was a safe in the walk in closet, always good to have on a trip. The AC worked well, everything was clean - the staff were terrific and allowed us to keep all of our luggage in one of the rooms for a late check out at 3pm (instead of noon) - then, they allowed us to leave our luggage in a locked room in the lobby, as we were still working and needed to leave for the airport about 5pm - they arranged a car to take us to the airport in Newark too - I didn't think it was possible to find a spacious clean room in NYC in a great area, within walking distance of everything, in July for an affordable rate - $251.93 a night!

The room was much larger than I was expecting and the bed was soooo comfortable. The hotel's Co-Op restaurant food and service was excellent. The staff were so friendly and professional even through the lack of power and hot water after Sandy hit the entire team were in high spirits and looked after us very well. The location was excellent, a short walk to Greenwich and SoHo....much better than being in the tourist hub of Times Square. Can't say a bad word about this hotel.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

763,My first night at this place so far looking pretty good. I'm on the 8th floor in a King Executive room. The bed is nice with lots of extra pillows etc. As a business traveler the one thing I'm really liking is the lamps by the bed have 2 plugins on the base of each of them!!! This is great for charging the laptop/cell so I can have them right by/convenient. I hate having to go digging behind the beds/bedstands to find plugins. There was a bathrobe/slippers on the bed when I got here as well as chocolates on the pillows. I am diamond w/ hhonors which might have counted for some of the stuff. The bathroom is very nice and they even provide a little squishy scrubby shower thing which is cool never seen a hotel provide that before and I travel quite a bit.

### Explanation:
1. **For the ""buffet and rooms"" aspect**:
   - All agents identified the ""buffet"" and ""rooms"" as separate aspects. Both aspects were treated as positive with opinions like ""love"" and ""a BIT better"", with a sentiment intensity score of 2. The categories selected were ""food_drinks quality"" for the buffet and ""rooms general"" for rooms.

2. **For the ""MGM"" aspect**:
   - Both mentions of MGM had positive sentiment with a score of 3. This was generally because of terms like ""nothing wrong"" and ""gorgeous place"". The category agreed upon was ""hotel general"".

3. **For the additional buffet mention**:
   - All agents agreed on the positive sentiment of ""soooo good"" with a strong score: typically 4 (Agent 1 and 2) or 5 (Agent 3). ""Food_drinks quality"" was chosen based on a majority agreement.

4. **For ""ambience, appointments, lighting and art""**:
   - The combination of these aspects was addressed as one with a unifying positive opinion term ""beautiful"" and categorized under ""service design_features"" with an intensity score of 4, which reflects the consensus from Agent 3."
772,"Stayed at the Wellington during the week of Thanks Giving. First trip to NY.
19th floor room was, while not large, was big enough for the 2 of us, was comfortable and clean with maid service every day, the staff polite and helpful, even extended our use of the room on final day, due to late flight back to the UK, at no extra cost. 
Only suggestion is that a kettle, for tea and coffee making, in the rooms would have been a bonus....
Having read some of the reviews was a little worried but having stayed there would stay again.
Location was great, able to visit all we wanted to see either by walking or use of public transport, subway station and bus stops right outside of hotel.
Local deli's provide a wide range of foods. 
With the window open got the real sounds of the hustle and bustle of the city, just like the films....
Would recommend it to friends and family.","```json

For this price, they could have gotten a nice one that is strong enough for Boston rain. The room was ok with flat screen tv, though I feel it's more like 3* hotel. Perhaps it's a small lobby or something. The staffs were pretty cold and I didn't remember seeing them smile at all, except for the bellboy that helped me with my bags when I left. I also got a rash on my face the next morning so I didnt' know whether I got it from the bedbug or from their towels. Also water was running all night from the tub which was annoying.

**Explanation:**
- **Group 1 (hotel general):** Consensus among agents is that ""loved"" expresses a strong positive sentiment; majority intensity suggests 4.
- **Group 2 (location general):** Integration of opinions across agents led to combining phrases, with consensus on positive sentiment and higher intensity score.
- **Group 3 (rooms comfort):** All agents aligned on words used, sentiment, and intensity score; no changes needed.
- **Group 4 (transportation/facilities general):** Although identified differently, consensus on neutral sentiment. ""facilities general"" aligns more with usage context.
- **Group 5 (hotel general):** Consistency in positive sentiment with a moderate intensity score of 3, reflecting the majority viewpoint."

**Explanation:**
- **Aspect Term ""location"":** All agents identified ""location"" with a ""perfect"" sentiment. The consensus was a strong positive sentiment with a minor variance in intensity (either 4 or 3). I've decided 4 as the score which is 2 out of 3 agents' choice.
  
- **Aspect Term ""stay"":** There was a disagreement about sentiment polarity and intensity. However, two agents aligned that the phrase ""no problems"" is positive with an intensity leaning toward moderate (score of 2 seems appropriate given two agents suggest it as positive).

- **Aspect Term ""returning"":** All agents unanimously agreed on the term and sentiment. It’s marked as strong positive with intensity score 5 without contrarian signals, indicating unequivocal satisfaction and intent to return."

793,"I recently stayed at The Cooper Square Hotel wanting it to be the Soho Grand but as it was 150 usd cheaper I decided to give it a go! I arrived with my husband feeling sulky and sullen because it wasnt the Soho Grand which I visit on a regular basis but once I'd lifted my sulky face out of my handbag I realised we were in for a nice surprise! The reception you receive is great! No standing hanging around to check in. As soon as you arrive your case is swept away and you are told to take a seat in the library, offered a glass of fizz or wine whilst they check you in - perfect! The rooms are typically new york small but clean, light and airy and quiet - no honking of ny taxis here!!! I must say the bed is adorable and I slept like a log every night - the duvet and pillows were heavenly too! 
The bar and restuarant in the hotel are really cool and the drinks and food are fab!
The area around the hotel is definitely developing so not as sleek as soho or uptown but really interesting with some gorgeous little bars and restaurants to discover in the local area.
I'd recommend the hotel but wouldnt stay in your room too long as you may start to get cabin fever - theres too much going on outside your room anyway so thats not going to be a problem!!","```json

### Reconciliation Notes:
1. **Staff Aspect:**
   - Both LLM Agents 1 and 2 marked the sentiment as ""positive"" with high intensity scores, with agent 1 assigning a 5 and others a 4. The conclusion favored the stronger consensus of ""positive"" with intensity of 5.

2. **Location Aspect:**
   - Agent 2 provided a ""neutral"" sentiment, whereas Agent 3 provided ""positive"". For uniformity and considering the sentiment of proximity as a neutral geographic fact, ""neutral"" with 0 is adopted.

3. **Hotel Rooms Aspect:**
   - All three agents agree the sentiment is ""positive"". Intensity from Agent 1 and 3 is higher, supported by Agents 2 and 3's propensity for moderate expression each at 2 and 3. Final score averaged to 3 for better balance.

4. **Granite Sinks/Beds Aspect:**
   - Agents 1 and 2 only recognized beds with ""positive"" sentiment. Agent 3 addressed both ""granite sinks"" neutrally and ""beds"" with high positive sentiment. The compound is broken into two distinct aspects (""granite sinks"" with neutral and ""beds"" with intense positive).

Final outputs maintain aspects integrity identified by at least two agents while ensuring the prominent sentiments are uniformly represented."
803,"I suprised my daughter with a trip to NYC for her 18th birthday. We stayed at the Hampton Inn 35th St. / Empire State Building from 3/27-4/2/2009. Following is how I'd sum it up:
Excellent location - convenient to both Uptown and Downtown / Very friendly and helpful staff / Small rooms (it's NYC), but clean and functional / Free WiFi / Included breakfast (hot and cold items) a big plus / Coffee, water and juices 24-7 / Printing stuff off in the Business Center invaluable / Nice gym / Check around on the discount sites and you can find GREAT (and I MEAN GREAT) prices - we did!! We will return to NYC,and I will definitely stay here again!!!","[

The beds were super cushy with down comforters. The room size was average for a big city, but the bathroom was big I thought. Also we could walk to almost anything, North End, Fanueil Hall.

I appreciated the courtesy and flexabilty shown by the all of the staff. From the hotel operator, to the front desk staff, I was treated with respect and excellent customer service. All in all, I would definately recommend this hotel to anyone traveling to Pasadena.

**Explanation:**

1. **Atmosphere:** All agents identified ""atmosphere"" with high sentiment intensity, achieving consensus on positive sentiment with maximum intensity (5).

2. **La Quinta/Location:** The agents delivered contrasting results on aspect term; however, aligning with the context of the recommendation, I've opted for ""La Quinta"" as an aspect term and maintained the positive sentiment polarity and intensity score suggested by most agents.

3. **Room:** There's slight variation in categories and intensity scores among agents. Ultimately, the category ""rooms comfort"" and adjusted sentiment intensity score of 4 is chosen to reflect majority agreement and the cumulative positive emphasis on room features.

4. **Employees:** While expressed opinions and sentiment scores varied, a combined approach favors positive sentiment, with an intensity of 4, echoing the general positive remarks about ""employees.""

5. **Facilities:** This additional aspect derived from Agent 3 reinforced facilities as noteworthy, with positive sentiment in the facilities general category, assessed with an intensity score of 3, reflecting the agreement among agents that mention facilities positively."
820,"pros:
great check in staff , they were awesome
loved decor of room
awesome bed sooooooo comfy
awesome big shower even though room small
free internet
free water in room
very clean 
cons:
on a yucky street not ""right in soho"" have to walk a couple of blocks
room is the smallest in new york, if you have a family and lots of luggage will not fit, nowhere to put luggage, and only very small armoir no cupboard, but still very comfortable room 
Even with cons(very little) I would stay here again. Love soho and it was only a 3 block walk into the heart of Soho.
Regarding past comments if you go to New York and expect a quiet room GO SOMEWHERE ELSE YOU ARE IN THE WRONG CITY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You will never find a quiet room in New York where you do not here the city outside your room.
You want a nice view in New York city from your then you have to pay for it, becuase nice views are very limited here.","```json

### Explanation:
1. **Aspect Term and Aspect Category:**
   - ""Customer Service"" was identified as an aspect term by all agents in relation to the overall service satisfaction. It logically falls under the ""service general"" category as verified by all agents.
   - ""rooms"" was noted by two agents, with minor variance in categories (""hotel cleanliness"" vs. ""rooms general""). Given the focus on how clean the rooms were, and the fact it's related to the hotel's general service provision, ""rooms general"" was chosen with a bit broader context encompassing cleanliness.
   - ""staff"" was specifically identified by one agent but included under ""service general"" by others through the context of service satisfaction. Inclusion under ""service general"" helps capture its broader service context.

2. **Opinion Terms:**
   - For ""Customer Service,"" the opinion terms were consistent across agents with minor synonyms or similar sentiment expressions merged for completeness.
   - For ""rooms,"" the key positive descriptions were ""so clean"" and ""made it easier"" from combined agents' outputs.
   - For ""staff,"" the only explicit opinion term unique to it was ""made it easier,"" aligning with the service-related sentiment of staff efforts.

3. **Sentiment Polarity and Intensity Score:**
   - ""Customer Service"" had unanimous strong positive sentiments throughout, rated a 5 based on multiple agents' sentiment intensity scores.
   - ""rooms"" maintained a consistent positive sentiment, settled at an intensity score of 3 due to variances noted by agents but leaning universally positive.
   - ""staff,"" indicated mainly through the effect of easing guest requirements, was specified with a slightly moderate positive sentiment, assigning an intensity score of 2 consistent with targeted agent assessments."

**Rationale:** 
- The aspect term ""The Madison Hotel"" is consistently identified across agents for the first group, with sentiment ranging between 2 and 4; I consolidated it to 3 to average the scores.
- ""Stay"" is identified as an aspect for the ""enjoyed"" opinion, with consistent sentiment intensity of 2, across LLM Agents 2 and 3 – thus, that's what was used.
- ""Customer service"" aspect was also consistently defined with sentiments ranging from 4 to 5; the intensity score of 4, as an average and moderation of intense positivity, was used.
- The recommendation of ""The Madison Hotel"" appeared with similar intensity around 3-4; hence a medium intensity of 3 is consistent with the collective input.
- Lastly, the ""AWESOME!!!!"" sentiment about the stay is unmistakably intense and positive across all, hence the intensity of 5 is reflected."

The room was very clean and modern abit on the small side, but overlooking the courtyard was better than overlooking a road. Wine tasting is served between 5pm-6pm which is great after a long day sight seeing. On check out again, we had a rude receptionist, as you can be charged to use your room safe or ask for it to be waivered.

**Explanation:**

1. **Aspect Term:** For the first aspect, all three agents agreed on similar phrases, but the term ""overall experience"" from Agent 1, most closely reflects the common theme. For the second aspect, ""staff"" was agreed upon by all agents.

2. **Aspect Category:** All agents agreed on ""hotel general"" for the first aspect and ""service general"" for the second aspect.

3. **Opinion Term:** While Agent 2 included an extra term in one of its entries, the most consistently agreed upon opinion terms across agents for the first aspect are ""the best,"" and the second aspect retains ""very courteous"" and ""helpful.""

4. **Sentiment Polarity:** All three agents concluded that the sentiment was positive for both aspects.

5. **Sentiment Intensity Score:** A score of 5 is maintained from Agent 1 and Agent 3 for the ""overall experience"" aspect as these intensities are reflective of strong positive sentiment. For the ""staff"" aspect, a consensus stronger score is derived as a 4, considering the range given by all agents."
834,"I can't say enough about this hotel!!! The location is great because you have easy access to everything San Francisco, without having to deal with the high ""touristy"" areas every night. There are street cars that run right next to hotel which can bring you directly to either Fisherman's Wharf, or the Mission District. The cable cars start 1 block away. The Ferry Building is directly across the street, which you can easily get to Sausalito and Vallejo (which is what we did to get to Napa). The hotel staff was extremely courteous and ALWAYS helpful. The conceirges seemed to go out of their way to get even the simplest request for information quickly and accurately. The rooms were spotless and very comfortable (I would highly recommend spending the extra $$$ for the Superior Waterfront View because the view of the Bay and the Bay Bridge is incredible any time of the day, during any weather). I have never written an online recommendation before, but I am so glad to do so now!!!

835,"I stayed at the Westin St. Francis for 4 nights on business. It got off to a bad start. I arrived near midnight from the airport and the hotel did not have my reservation in the system. Luckily, I had the email confirmation to show them. The gentleman helping me was able to get me a standard room at the nightly rate that I had reserved. It took a little bit of time to get things straightened out and at that late hour, all I really wanted was to get check-in quickly over with. I gave them my Platinum SPG number. Unfortunately, the hotel was not able to recognize my Platinum status for some reason. The reason one stays with Starwood is the excellent treatment for Platinum members and if that's missing, then one might as well stay at any other business hotel in the area like the Grand Hyatt or the JW Marriott. I don't blame the Westin St. Francis particularly; it's very likely a problem with the central reservation system through www.starwoodhotels.com.
My standard room was 2 double beds in the new tower because I wanted some more space than the classic rooms in the old tower. The room was around 300 sq ft. The room decor is typical corporate blandness, but it's new and modernized The bathroom was a very good size with a bathtub that had double showerheads. (But I thought the toilet was out of a Motel 6 as it did not fit in at all with the higher class Westin image. It seemed cheap and cheaply installed.) The bed was comfortable and up to the Heavenly bed standard. The walls seemed to do the job to block noise from adjacent rooms. I did hear noise from the hallways but there's really nothing one can do about it.
I did not get to use the WiFi. Also I did not get to use the health/fitness center.
There are many elevators and the wait for them was fairly short. The hallways are well lit and very clean. The lobby is grand and certainly very attractive, but I noticed there are not many seating areas for guests who need to wait around or meet someone. There's a coffee shop directly opposite reception that has seating but it would seem you need purchase their food. The location in Union Square is excellent for tourists and those traveling for fun. This hotel wasn't my first choice since I needed to walk over to the financial district for work (about 15 mins brisk pace). All in all, I cannot say with confidence that I would stay here again due to the bad start.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

839,"went to stay for one night with my hubby, shower was beautiful..one of those waterfall ones. but if you're looking for a hotel name while driving up madison avenue, which is stressful enough as it is, dont bother as there is no hotel name out front..just the street number. its on purpose, so it feels more like home. as a visitor, i prefer to have the name on front so when i stumble out of a bicycle rickshaw at 3 am drunk i know where i am. 
the bed was super comfy, i wanted to take it home with me. we had a 2 room suite, it was ok..lots of comfy pillows. 
the free breakfast was nice as it ended at noon, not at 10 am like other hotels.....we never make it to those as who wants to get out of bed that early for a bagel?? it was the basics, creeal, fruit, pastrys...they were pretty bland though.
but seriously, when you cant figure out how to work the lights in the bathroom when youre sober, its too difficult. too confusing...just give me a switch!! 
all in all it was a ok place, the staff was friendly.","```json

840,"We have stayed at this hotel a few times in the past few years for a conference. This time, the front desk staff attitude was slightly better than the previous years, but don't expect them to be super welcoming. They are cold, and do the bare minimum of what they need to do. The rooms are ok, nothing too fancy, and relatively clean. For $500+/night, you get the room and nothing else. We got one newspaper for the four nights we stayed. There is no WiFi in the rooms. They charge you extra $15 per day for WiFi. Seriously? I guess Hilton hasn't realized it is almost 2012 and WiFi is really available for free everywhere else. You can access WiFi in the lobby free of charge, but there is no place to sit in the lobby. There is a starbucks in the hotel, but unlike other starbucks don't offer WiFi (I guess the hotel doesn't let them)!!!
Oh, and the HHonners...really, you get nothing for it unless you are a diamond member.

842,"I arrived at our room at around 10pm after being at the Carlsbad Econolodge and Leogoland for two days. What a downgrade in rooms. Since we were going to Sea World I wanted a closer hotel which this hotel is close to Sea World. The property is clean and the guests all appeared to be family's like us on vacation. The property is non smoking in the rooms so guests stand outside and smoke which in my opinion is worse for our non smoking family. The hotel did not appear to have any breakfast other than the free complimentary one that was in a large room off the lobby. The items for my stay was an apple, orange, bananna, coffee, Milk, Cereal, and danish/muffins. Nothing worth writing home about. 
Now for the problems with the room. The blanket under the comforter had hairs on it. Gross!!!
We stripped the beds and just used the whte sheet. The beds are doubles. When we arrived the air conditioner and refrigerator were turned off. The room was hot and smelled stale. The air conditioners had two speeds high/low. Medium was broke. The refrigerator was the small dorm room style which took a day to cool. Then after I was gone for the day at Sea World the cleaning person turned my air conditoner off after I purposely left it on so I could come back to a cool room after a long hot day. The bathtub water spout was also set to bath a person who would be no taller than 5'. I would guess that if your over 6'4 you would not even be able to stand in the shower as my head was almost touching the ceiling in the tub. No a great showering experience. I only paid about $70 with tax per night if you pay more than this I would recommend staying somewhere else. Old Town which is across the street has some nice shops.","[

845,"I stayed at Jacksonville CP Riverfront Dec. 31 to Jan 3. The hotel desk staff were wonderfully friendly people and I commend the hotel for that. In addition, the beds were amazing - not like any other hotel I have stayed in. 
That said, the room (which did have a great view over the river) was TINY. The bathroom vanity was so small there was not enough room for makeup bags for two female travelers. Yes, the room was old and outdated but I could have lived with that. Yes, it was during the Gator Bowl, it was New Years Eve and people were partying in the halls a bit. I could have lived with that too.
What KILLED IT for me was the SLAMMING DOORS all night long. I could even have lived with THAT had it not been for previous reviews stating that such was a problem. Like other past guests, I too was assured by management the problem would be addressed. My best guess is that the doors are still a-slammin' while CP Jacksonville Riverfront rakes in $369/nt. during special events AND charges $10.00 per day for parking to boot!!! (Manager told me in an email that probably shouldn't have been done, given the room rate, but I didn't see a refund on my credit card statement!).

**Rationale:**

- **Aspect Term 1:** All agents agreed on ""posizione"". The sentiment intensity score varied slightly, but 4 was chosen as the median between the agents.

- **Aspect Term 2:** ""quattro stelle"" was used by majority. The ""hotel general"" category was chosen with a sentiment score averaged to -2 (consensus between Agent 1 and 3).

- **Aspect Term 3:** While the aspect terms differed between ""controllo accessi,"" ""hall,"" and ""accesso,"" they all imply concerns about the hotel's entrance control. ""Accesso"" was chosen as it's common and clear. Opinion terms were consolidated for coherence, and a -3 intensity was assigned based on consensus between majority of the agents. The ""service general"" category fits the context best according to the common findings of the agents."
847,"The hotel is very conveniently located for business in the financial district and some of its design features are impressive. However, good design does not automatically mean good quality in interior execution. Given that the place is open since January 2010, my -very nicely proportioned- room looked pretty shabby already. The cheap wood flooring was severly scratched and worn, wear and tear on furniture, crafting pretty bad. Staff / service VERY mixed experience. The guy checking us in was very nice and helpful, so were the staff at the restaurant for breakfast; most other ""hosts"", i.e. receptionists, were pretty arrogant in communication and service responses. I have no clue where that attitude comes from and why it is being toterated, but makes you think why these people took a carreer choice in the hospitality industry.... Lets summarize the rest: beautiful black bahroom, very low water pressure, so the rainshower looks like more fun that it turns out to be; housekeeping so,so; free good quality drinks in the minibar; nice Geneva sound system. Would I recommend it: yes, for the next year - after that the guest room fittings should look somewhat worn down - plus dont expect genuinely interested service by front office / concierge. If you can live with that - go for it.","```json

I asked if I could pay cash at desk because I hate hotel holds on MY money. They said it was cheaper to use the card because cash would be almost $300 anyway (for an 85.00 stay???) Marriott adds $20-$25 if you pay cash or stay on points. 
So after check out I see a $229 and $50 hold! After looking at our receipt, the total bill with valet was $119.00. What sense does this make. I figured Monday it would fall off and actual charges would be applied. Nope. Called my bank Tues. and they said the hotel could call them and they'd drop it. Called the hotel. They claimed they would, but I knew they wouldn't. Gave me the speech about how many days a hold could be on....really? And YOU'D be ok if this was your checking acct? We were 5 days gone at this point. 
Long story short. Actual charges were applied late in the week. Largest hold came off Thusday (6 days after check out) and the $50 by Friday. Ridiculous. 
I will NEVER stay with this lot of thieves again. A cash payment should be for the room price and a small incidental fee. And holding for almost $300 on an $85 room? Peace Westin. Back to Marriott. They treat us well and don't bust our account ""because they can"".","```json

852,"The positives for this hotel, were the location, the comfortable bed and the front desk...the concierge was particularly warm and friendly, though we didn't actually need his services. The negatives were....The room was very small, even by NY standards. The air conditioning was barely adequate and very noisy, but my biggest complaint was the shower. It had a great rain shower head, but the water was only slightly more than a trickle! Very hard to actually take a shower. This stay was only okay for me...I expected much more.","```json

854,"I was a little disappointed as to the outside of the building when we arrived. The plants on the porch were not very appealing and seemed to cheapen the decor. Also the windows of the rooms were dirty, could be due to the proximity to the street. Also the walkways were not clean but the rugs to our room could have used some updating. lus trying to find out room was a little confusing by the signs outside. We were told by the hotel staff to be sure not to leave any valuables in the car and be sure it is locked. While it is close to the T and the wait is not long at all the ride into town was over 30 mintues. The eating area where the breakfast is available was very small and didn't allow many to eat at a time. The food was the usual nothing out of the ordinary when you have to help yourself. I was diappointed with the room. I beleive there was suppposed to be a picture above the bed but there was just a nail and a paint missing from the wall. The bathroom must have been recently updated but wasn't finished professionally. A little disappointing.","```json

855,"When you walk into your room, I think your first response will be...seriously, this is HUGE! For one person, I thought I had been misplaced. The room was a suite. I think it would've been better if I wasn't paranoid and actually stayed with someone else. Being alone in the huge room styled in the olden days was ..to sum it up in one word..creepy. Three of my colleagues and I were down at the bar discussing the rooms. We are three ladies, traveling alone and each in our own rooms. We were all talking about how creepy the rooms are and how we each may be sleeping with the lights and tv on. I heard noises at times....it all sounded like people running up and down the halls either above me or outside of my door. There were never any voices, just running footsteps. This happened a few times, and it never lasted very long. There are mirrors above the beds that serve no purpose. It's not like you can do your makeup in the mirrors. They are old, and they make the things in the room look strange. There is also a normal mirror in the bathroom and then on both sides, there are two mirrors with candle looking lights in front of it. These are the lights for the bathroom. The mirrors are not something you can see yourself in. It's just really strange. If you like the old feel, this may be the place for you. On the up side, the staff is extremely nice and very willing to help!!! The maid service, the front desk, the concierge, the valet, doormen, restaurant staff, all EXCELLENT! If I hadn't been alone, I may have given this another notch. Location of hotel--it's in the business district, so if you're near here on the weekend...most things are closed. Be very careful is you're walking alone..lots of homeless people and some are straight up crazy! There is a police station and a jail in walking distance too. If you're walking towards the grassy knoll, which is about four blocks away, be careful if you go alone.","```json

Nosotros teniamos una habitación superior con baño, pero de superior nada... 
Por otro lado aconsejaros que intenteis conocer a John en la recepción porque es encantador y os da todo tipo de trucos para divertirte sin gastar mucho dinero. El resto de los empleados no son tan agradables...
Cuando llegamos al hotel nos cobraron 700 USD de mas (totalmente inesperados) porque segun recuerdo tienes que pagar el 14,5% mas de lo que te cuesta la reserva (nosotros la hicimos por clickbed.com) y 3,5USD por persona y noche por dormir en Manhattan... vamos una pasta..

* Justification:
    - The aspect term ""price"" and opinion term ""save a few bucks"" are correct as the sentiment towards the price savings is consistently positive and classified under 'hotel prices'.
    - The location being ""centrally located"" is unanimously positive, hence placed in 'location general', along with the opinion on saving $50, indicating positive remarks on cost.
    - For the room, all agents highlighted issues like ""very small"", ""barely any closet space"", and ""terrible lighting"", which are overt negative opinions impacting 'rooms comfort'.
    - The sentiment regarding future preference to ""pay a little more"" has been concluded as neutral, as it reflects a personal decision without strong positive or negative emotion, aligning with 'hotel general'."
860,"This hotel MAY be a 3 1/2 star establishment??? It is clean. It appears that it would be nice for convention/conference needs. It also seems to be the Indy Hotwire ""special"". Although, I hear later this year they are converting it to a student facility. For what it's worth, and while it is still available, I would spend some extra money and find a hotel that is truly in the downtown Indy area. This place is NOT really downtown. The rooms were nice. However, there are NO extras offered at all here. No lobby coffee, no continental breakfast, no free parking (at $18-this makes the Hotwire deal not so great). This was not a bad experience, I would just go somewhere else next time. (And not book on Hotwire, just in case.)","```json

861,"Actually, i had just left the Hotel Carter (ABYSSMAL!) and when we pulled up to this hotel, i actually breathed a sigh of relief! what an amazing location! the bellhops were jonny-on-the-spot with our bags and we were whisked inside. i'm here as part of a production crew, so they handled all the niceties with the front desk. i was placed in a room on a very high floor, and i found it very comfortable, tho it did have stained and dingy carpets. the lobby is beautiful with several restaurants therein, and the location is AMAZING to see whatever you want in times square, and madison square garden is RIGHT across the street! 
the cleaning staff were there when i needed them, and i even requested batteries for my remote and a gentleman came right up to give me some. there was NO internet connection available in the room i was using, however there was web tv... mine didn't work tho. no matter, prices were exorbitant.
but not as exorbitant as the fone bill. i made several unconnected calls from my room and ended up with a bill of over 300$! so i went down to the front desk and with the help of a nice lady, she erased the charges that were not connected. i still ended up with about 100$ when i connected on about 5 calls - which i suppose is not really the hotels fault, but a bigger problem involving more telecommuncations companies. i was still grateful for her assistance.
tho we did have to change rooms a few times, we stayed about 4 or 5 nights. i had a grand time at this place! it felt very safe, and if i was ever bored, then i just went for a walk. tv worked excellently, tho there did seem to be lots of kids running up and down the halls....
could use some updating, but all in all, a good place to get some sleep.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

864,"I chose this facility due to reviews made on Tripadvisor. Overall my room was clean and everything worked. I will say with I-17 freeway being so close I was able to count the cars at night, especially trucks. The room I was assigned is toward the rear of the property so things can't be better closer toward the freeway. I attempted to make a toll free call from my room two hours after arriving and could not dial out. Searching for assistance I called the front desk and was told to give it a ""little time"" and they would have the problem solved. A half hour went by with better results so I called the front desk again. I was told someone was going to come to my room to remedy the issue. No representative came to my room. I made four calls in three hours. After three hours passed they quit answering my calls so I called their main number from my cell phone. I asked to speak with a supervisor and was told he had just left for the day. The person answering, Johnny, asked if he could assist me so I told him who I was and was in room ---. He said please hold. I did for a few minutes. Johnny came back on the line and said ""try it now"". I did and it worked. Whatever Johnny did he could have done in the previous hours. It was a very frustrating experience. Last night with rain falling in Phoenix I was awakened many times with the loud sound of a lot of rain pouring on something metal. This morning I went outside to find out what kept me awake most of the night. On the back of the building there are no gutters nor overhang from the roof. Rain from the roof was falling straight down and falling on a metal security light. That light was opposite the headboard. There might as well not even been a wall between the light and the headboard as it was loud enough to keep anyone awake all night. One other issue was upon driving up to my room after being gone all day I found a male employee attempting to enter my room. I asked what he wanted and he said there was a water leak in my room. After examining the kitchen and bath there was not a water leak anywhere. Not sure what his intentions were beyond that I was puzzled as to his true agenda. I am thankful I came back to my room when I did. There are many places to stay in Phoenix. My suggestion is to try somewhere else.","Final Consolidated ABSA Result:

This conclusion integrates observations from the three agents to focus on the aspects most consistently identified, such as cleanliness, noise issues, and service frustrations. Discrepancies, such as different aspect terms for service, were resolved in favor of the most comprehensive view. The intensity scores and sentiment polarities represent a balanced interpretation of the agents' findings, reflecting general agreement and providing a holistic summary of the user's experiences."
865,"We stayed here for three nights. Brittany at the front desk was nice to let my dad check in even though i wasn't with him.(room was in my name)...I arrived later.
The room was dirty. Had to ask the front desk for new sheets...I made the beds over myself. When I asked for more pillowcases was told they had run out! (Explains why the beds were dirty to begin with). Like stated in a few previous post....in three days there, never once saw a vacuum cleaner. i even asked for a garbage bag from one of the house keepers and her cart didn't even have a place for a vacuum! I don't like people entering my hotel room, so we never had housekeeping enter after we checked in. Bring slippers to wear, or don't take your shoes off. 
Breakfast was ok. Not a full breakfast, just a expanded continental. No eggs/protein. Only carbs: Waffles, biscuits and gravy, bagels, muffins, fruit and yogurt. Juice and coffee. Hardly any seating. All mornings just got a plate and went back upstairs.
Shuttle Service: Saw the lines...waited 30 min then took a cab. Didn't want to spend more of my vacation waiting for a shuttle. If you're up to it, Independence Hall is about a 15-20min walk up a slight hill. 
Parking: Expensive. Street parking is free after 10pm and until 8am. Several blocks away(south..turn right from the driveway.. on Columbus) there is a lot for $10/overnight; $8 during the day....park there and call for the shuttle. 
Check out: CHECK YOUR BILL!!!! They charged me for three days of parking when I only used one, and charged me for a microwave and fridge that never arrived!
Would I stay again...yes, but I'd check my bed first again and ask them to explain the charges before signing (that's how I found the over charges). This is a nice place if you're someone who can roll with the punches. The beds are comfortable, and the breakfast does give you a nice ""snack"" to start your day. They just need to learn how to manage their high volume of visitors.","```json

866,"My daughter and I stayed at the MK on Aug. 11-13. We arrived before 3pm and our room was available immediately. The decor and condition of the rooms is dated with lots and wear and tear but no obvious dirt, odor, and I'm happy to say, no bedbugs!. I had booked this hotel in April and as I rely heavily on Tripadvisor information to make many travel choices was worried because the latest reviews for this hotel have been bad, very bad. I went so far as to book another hotel and cancelled it at the last minute b/c the location of the MK appeared to be great. So, I hoped for the best and did make a good choice in terms of location. I liked the size of the hotel...........it has a cozy feel and nice bar. The staff members were friendly and helpful. Now the big question I always ask myself when trying to evaluate a hotel.....would I stay there again? I wouldn't reply with a resounding, NO. This was my first trip to Chicago and I don't consider the stay a mistake. But I saw other hotels in prime locations that I would like to try.","```json

867,"A long overnight stop on the way back to the UK after a family adventure holiday in Peru, dictated some luxury. The Parker Meridien provided some but perhaps not enough.

They allowed us to checkin early (but forgot that we pre-booked a late check-out) The swimming pool was nice (but the attendants were very protective of long-term hotel residents and strictly limited access) The room was excellent, the best hotel bed/linen/duvet we've ever had (but no-one came to makeup the sofa bed, we did it ourselves, but then found the sheets had been used by previous residents) The bathroom was sleek and worked well (but was full of small black flies) Breakfast was NY -rich and huge, (but the service was a little overbearing and children didn't like it much) The mirrored reception area looks as though it should hide lots of mysteries, (but it doesn't - the whole thing is very clinical) The reception and door staff were first class (the room staff weren't) 
It's rather like that large class of good restaurants which do two excellent course but a lacklustre third.

868,"Not your father's business hotel, and maybe not yours either. The lobby becomes a disco with a DJ at night. Coming home late from a show, expect to wander through crowds of drunk people gyrating to loud music. Say hello to the big bouncer stationed by the elevators to keep these people confined to the lobby.
Welcome to your room. Strangely shaped, you say? Yes, why *didn't* they take another 15 sq ft or so off the ample bedroom to make a bathroom that isn't so small you can't open the door all the way without it banging into the sink?
How do you like the decor? What shall we call it? Hmmm, maybe 1980's Playboy Magazine Chic? The broken lampshade and the towel rack that falls off the wall whenever touched do spoil the mood a little. But don't worry: I'm sure the maid is used to mopping up the water that is just naturally going to wind up on the bathroom floor from the shower stall that has neither a door or a curtain.
That being said, the location of the hotel is excellent. When you're feeling down about your room, you can walk across the street in one direction to the Marriott to see what an affordable hotel looks like or across Lexington to the Waldorf Astoria to see what a really nice hotel looks like.
With any luck, you won't have to wait until 6:30 pm to get into a room because the Starwood Preferred Guest in your room is exercising his privilege of ""late check out"". Thanks, guys, for the compensatory free bar vouchers; I don't drink.
I was in a two-day meeting in the hotel, and I will say that the meeting rooms are superb. I've probably never been in a nicer hotel meeting space, and the catering for the meeting was also excellent.
Everyone I dealt with at the hotel was professional, cordial and eager to serve.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

870,"I have been to New York several times so am not writing this as a novice visitor. We stayed at the London for 7 nights and our friends for 5 nights. We were on the 10th floor and our friends on the 30th. Our suite was better in terms of size, they had a great view. We agreed on the following: (i) overall, we have stayed in better hotels in New York for little or no more money (ii) the service at the London is patchy - the conscierge team was generally very good but the reception and restaurant people were ""functional"" - one thing that really hacked me off was when ckecking-out we were neither asked whether we had enjoyed our stay nor thanked for our custom (iii) the lighting and the decor throughout the hotel is gloomy, but especially so in the suites (almost impossible to read a book in the sitting room after dark) (iv) the cleaning staff did a good job but housekeeping generally could have been much improved. In addition, in our room the sliding door to the bathroom hardly fitted the frame and came off its runner with annoying regularity. On the plus side the hotel is very clean and the location excellent - between Central Park and Times Square and between 6th and 7th so handy for MOMA, Met Museum, shops, Lincoln Centre etc. 
We will not be rushing back to the London NY. There is no denying that to have a suite in New York is something of a luxury but as you don't go to NYC to spend time in a hotel I would have preferred a great room rather than an ""okay"" suite. I think I will go back to the Sofitel next time - smaller rooms than the London but great beds and bathrooms and, at the end of the day, those are the only two things that you really need in New York. Alternatively, whilst the Omni Berkshire was a little tired the last time I stayed (in 2008) the room size was amazing and is equally well located.","```json

El servicio por lo general es descortés y toma mucho tiempo en registrarse. El hotel tiene un diseño muy bonito y moderno.

Como yo no llevaba mucho equipaje y sólo pagué $150 usd/noche me pareció muy bien.

874,"Stayed here in late June 2012. Lovely room, sparsley but tastefully furnished. Beds and pillows were comfortable. A luxury elegant bathroom. The hotel foyer was vast and impersonal. We paid extra for a Bay View Room but the view we got was completely marred by a large black factory chimney and some aluminium venting on the building between the hotel and the waterfront. The so called infinity pool had been photographed so skilfully that the chimney and other premises could not be seen. There are no coffee making facilties in the room and so we had to have room service, this cost $20 for a pot of coffee for two (including room service charge and tip) Coffee was available for a limited period in the morning from the lobby. Valet Parking (no choice it's valet or nothing) was $39 per night. We chose this hotel from the web site and we feel that the photo was so misleading and resulted in us leaving the hotel a day earlier than planned. Despite the quality of the room and furnishings we consider that the hotel was extremely poor value for money. To be fair we completer a customer survey on line from the room and as a result the manager did give us a $50 per night refund which we received when we arrived home.
Pike pub is across the street and whilst noisy it is a convenient place to eat. Pike Market is a block away and worth a visit. Access to the waterfront is down a few flights of steps so beware if you find steps difficult. It is also worth considering that Seattle is very hilly. It also rains a lot!!!","```json

876,"I stayed here the weekend of 2/11-2/13 and the hotel looks really nice when you pull up and go into the lobby. That's when you find out you are going to pay $14/day to park your car. Seriously? I can stay at the intercontinental, Westin, or Omni and not have to pay to park my car. Then you get to your room. Very clean no issues there other then it looks like the last time it was updated was 1980. Nothing like watching TV on an old box TV when the shows that are being shown are in 16:9 widescreen format. That was nice...... Then you pay $13/day for internet access and it didn't work. I could not get online the help desk couldn't even get me online. Noone would give me a refund for this. The staff at the front desk is super nice i think the issue was just out of their hands. 
Getting to the hotel presents its issues also if you don't have a GPS and you aren't from the area good luck to you. I lived in Dallas for 2 years and had a hard time getting to the hotel for the first time. All in all if i had to recommend a hotel to a friend that wanted to stay in this area i would send them somewhere else. In the end this is not a 4 star hotel. If the rooms were updated it would be 4 star easily but its very dated and doesn't meet 4 star expectations.","```json

878,"I think the title says it all, but it's nice to find a hotel with waffles, eggs, coffee, juice, creals and breads included for free. The added bonus was that there was even nice wine and beer from a tap also for free during the weekday evenings, but check before going. They also had a mini buffett with a nice simple salad and some other food. I wished they had a vegetarian option other than the meat option for the buffet, but can't complain since it was free. The location is easy and close to the beach if you have a car. If not, it's too far to walk. But, there's a free shuttle that can drop you at the beach area in Del Mar and then pick you up when you're ready. The walls are a bit thin so you can somewhat hear your neighbors. The rooms are nicely decorated, but I'd wish they'd lose the silk plants. They are just dust collectors no matter how clean a room is. Couldn't they just get a simple real potted plant that does not require a lot of water? The flat screen TV was nice, and the bed had a poor quality mattress. I think you just need to make sure you really get a suite, as we thought we'd have one, and to our suprise, it was just a couch on the other side of the room opposite the bed! We were traveling with a small baby and wanted that extra room to be able to not disturb her when she was sleeping. I hear from others that the rooms do differ and some are really suite like with a separation between rooms, so make sure you ask for what you want if they have it available. I'd stay here again. Front desk was friendly and helpful. Next door is a SPA at the Hilton Garden Inn and I got a nice hair cut. It's a bit pretentious there with all the Spa rules though..they have a SPA Etiquette list on the back of the pamplet that made me almost not go there. I ended up going anyway to the spa for a haircut with my daughter and it was empty. Not sure why all the rules, but per the rules, they don't want kids (i.e ones that can make noise). Luckily they let me bring my kid who was good, but who wants to go to a place where you're not really welcome with your little one? I would have spent a heck of a lot more money there if they were more welcoming with in their pamplet. And especially since it was empty, don't think my kid would have disturbed anyone except the other staff if I had stayed to get a massage and facial!!!","Final Output:

No store, or shop, only options is getting things out of your mini bar, 4 dollars for a can soda. This hotel has a night club attached to the pool, so if your going to the hotel for relaxation, not such a great idea. At night, it is a local club with girls in there short skirts and 7 inch heels prancing aroung the bar and pool area. No hot tub. If your thinking of staying with family, not the hotel, if your going to party.... Perfect. Housekeeping was great the first 2 days, then last 2, you couldn't even tell they were there. The rooms all in all aren't much better than a Marriott or holiday inn, now they do have a sofa, and I stayed in a regular rooms. We did ask to check out the magnificent 7 hotels, are were shown about 4 of those, and they were super nice.

In this final consolidation, the following decisions were made based on input from the agents:

1. **Aspect Term:** 
   - ""Charles river"" was consistently agreed upon for location related mentions.
   - ""standard room"" was chosen as it reflects the consensus for the negative comment on room size.
   - For the 'cookie', ""large size cookie"" is used since it captures both the size aspect and welcome notion better than ""cookie"" or ""welcome gift.""

2. **Aspect Category:** 
   - ""Charles river"" is categorized as ""location general"" as all agents mostly agreed on the geographical significance.
   - The aspect term ""standard room"" remained within the ""rooms comfort"" category as it exclusively refers to the room size.
   
3. **Opinion Term and Sentiment Polarity:** 
   - The opinions ""generally helpful"" and ""polite"" were consistently noted for the ""staff"" aspect, with an added ""Keep it up."" phrase, underlining the positive appreciation.
   - ""smaller by american standards"" reflects agreement on the slightly negative sentiment concerning room size.

4. **Sentiment Intensity Score:** 
   - Scores were averaged where discrepancies occurred (for example, the sentiment for staff ranged from 2 to 3, leaning towards positive intensity). 
   - In cases of a clear majority agreement, like ""shuttle service"" being very positive, the highest intensity score was adopted.

884,"I guess I should have known better I might have had myself hyped for more. I grew up in Austin and have always wanted to stay here... For our one year ann. I total splurged and booked a room in the Historic part of the hotel. Paid $100 extra for the romance package which was 5 covered strawberries, champagne, turn down service and breakfast in the morning... First the entrance is gorgeous. No question and the girl at the desk was kind and wonderful we were running behind so we had to hurry or miss our dinner reservations. She heard us talking about it and offered to call the resturant and let them know we were on our way but might be a few minutes late. It was a save. The front desk girl was above and beyond. I did feel shorted once we got into our room which I felt was way too small and had a view of a brick wall. We were also told we could not have our dinner companions come up to our room to get ready to go out when we asked that they be sent up when they arrived. While waiting out front of the hotel for their taxi at the end of the evening we were told they couldn't wait there or in the lobby. We were not drunk or really drinking thru out the evening 2 glasses of wine. I felt that was rude. If we had been tipsey it would have been understandable. The breakfast was to die for!!!!! But all in all I felt it was way over priced for what we got... Oh and I found out later it was a 10 dollar bottle of champane if you go to specs...

886,"We just returned from 3 days at L'Enfant Plaza Hotel in Washinton DC. This hotel is in a great location. It was clean, the staff were very friendly and the concierge was extremely helpful. The Promenade mall in the lower level of the plaza and the metro station were very convenient. We were told that there are were no restaurants around, however, on our last night there, we ventured out for a walk and found 3 restaurants across the street by the marina. One was Sushi, one was chinese and one was a seafood buffet. It would have been a nice change from the restaurants in the hotel that were a bit pricey. Breakfast buffet was $16.00 an adult and the average entre on the dinner menu was $20.00. Take note that their dinner menu at this time of year is shortened, so not a lot of choice. There are a few places to eat in the promenade mall, some fast food, some cafeteria style food. It doesn't matter where you eat in Washington, it's expensive everywhere. Most of the museums etc....have cafes where you can grab a quick lunch. Our room was clean, but I think the hotel is a bit dated and is looking to do a full renovation this fall, so you may want to call them before you book. The pool was great, but would have nicer if it was open a little later than 8 p.m. If you want a hotel with a great location, this is it. I don't think you'll be disappointed. We would stay here again.","Final Consolidated ABSA Results:

887,"I wish I had read some of these other reviews before booking my 3-night stay here. The first night was the worst -- I had the room right across from the elevators (1201) and there were drunken people screaming in the hallways from basically 2 am to 4 am. Granted, it was a Saturday night, but I actually had a business meeting the next day and could have used the sleep. I called the front desk who told me they would send security, but that didn't do much (if they ever even came) and came very close to going all-New York on these jerks by opening by door and telling them to shut the (---- --). The next morning, when I complained again about the lack of sleep to the manager, I was given a coupon for a free breakfast. Given the lack of sleep, and the fact that I was actually there for business, I should have been given something a bit more valuable. I couldn't help but notice that several other people also complained about the noise that night.
I switched rooms for the next 2 nights and the noise wasn't as bad, though I could still hear the person next door sneeze, so the complaints about sound-proofing are spot on. 
It wasn't all bad: it is a cute hotel, the rooms were pretty spacious with nice features -- free (and reliable) WiFi is a must for me -- and the food in the restaurant was good and reasonably priced, especially compared with most other hotels. So if they could just fix the noise issue and perhaps group the bands of marauding drunken folks in one place away from everyone else, it would be a much better hotel.","```json

889,"Let me temper this...I am not usually a luxury hotel visitor. But we had a sudden trip to San Francisco and I looked to tripadvisor for recommendations. It seemed a lot of properties in San Fran were expensive, so I figured ""It's a special trip...let's blow the budget and stay in a luxury hotel"", and the Omni is rated #3 so we booked it for 4 nights. The pros: it is a beautiful property, and the bed was so comfortable and the room was very quiet. They clearly have excellent soundproofing, and as my husband is sensitive to noise, this was great. The cons: I was a bit surprised that at a near-to-$300/night property, I had to pay 95 cents a minute for local calls, and that the ""business center"" was a $6 charge for 15 minutes of internet. The coffee machine in the room didn't work well, and after leaving a note for staff requesting regular coffee packs only instead of half decaf, we still got the half regular and half decaf allotment each day. Granted, I'm sure if we called the front desk we would have been accommodated, but again, at a luxury property, I had an expectation that they would note our preferences. And the only real ""perks"" were a bit of fruit and iced tea available in the lobby in the afternoon - ??? So, all in all, it was a great sleep, but paying close to $300/night for a bed with really no luxury perks left me a tad disappointed.","```json

The wave restaurant is excellent. Food is delicious and service there is also very good.

892,"As many reviewers have noted this is a standard convention hotel that charges too much for the room and way too much for everything else ($12.95 a day for internet service--warning: wireless service is quite spotty and they cannot or will not do anything about this...including deduct the fee from your bill!). The rooms are fine and the beds are comfortable.
Was guaranteed a king-size bed, but when I got there it was not to be had. A nice girl at the desk took care of this and had me moved to the room I requested on my second day.
I guess it is still new and things are certainly glitchy. The showers have zero pressure, water so soft that you will feel soapy the entire time, and...this was my favorite....the water gets warm...never hot! There is a sign that says you may need to run the water for some time to get the right temperature, but if it gets anything warmer than warm it must take longer than ten minutes! (By the way, they place this sign next to another sign that says they won't clean towels unless you ask them to because they want to save water!)
The bar is fine with overpriced, but good drinks--the decor a modernism that reminds me of the UN Headquarters or mid-century Soviet. The gym is large and new, the lap pool looks great, but there is no sauna or hot tub.
I don't know--it is fine, not great...certainly not grand. Maybe in a year or so the place will be running smoother and the details will be worked out, but until then you might want to look elsewhere.","```json

893,"We reserved a King Superior room for 3 nights. When we checked in at 2pm, they said the King room we reserved was not available, and to come back in 1 hour.
At 3pm, they said all they have is a queen std. 
This room was soooo tiny, the size of my bedroom closet back home. Ok for s single, but way too small for 2 people.
3 other couples we were traveling with checked in later that day and all had issues with their rooms, A/C not working, room too small, etc.
After 24 hours of complaining, the manager finally was told by the bellhop to put us in a better room. At least the bellhop understands customer service. The manager didn't seem to care.
They moved us to a King suite. 
If I ever stay here again, I would only book that type of room.
Location was great, and they have a real nice bar area with a Jazz band.
I left my laptop power cord in my room when I checked out and after 3 phone calls, I finally gave up trying to get it back. They refused to send someone down to the room to look for it. They referred me back to the manager. like that was going to help..","```json

895,"Stayed here because of an early flight home. Check in was easy. We had paid for breakfast, but were leaving before 6am, when breakfast started... luckily when we pressed the issue we were given a voucher to contact room service for a continental breakfast, which we did. Room on 11th floor was lovely, clean and well kept, altho outside windows were pretty dirty. (But who cleans outside windows on the 11th floor?!!) 
View towards LA included flight path of planes landing - thrilling to watch as we were higher than them as they passed by, and yet triple glazing did a great job. Sleep number beds provided much entertainment!!!
We were so looking forward to having a drink in the bar at the top of the hotel, but when we took the lift up, it was closed. There seems to be construction going on, but there were no signs saying it was closed. Very disappointing.
We walked along to the LAX Marriott for dinner in the sports bar, as we found the grill in the Radisson a itttle expensive for us by the end of the holiday, but a farewell drink in the Radisson's lobby bar was very nice, good atmosphere.
Check out was quiet at 6am, but they tried to charge me for room service breakfast until I explained we'd had vouchers. 
As it's so close to LAX it seems to be the courtesy shuttle's final stop, meaning that the first shuttle was too full to take us to the airport. But because of the number of people waiting, the driver radioed ahead and within minutes had an empty bus pick us all up.","```json

897,"Stayed 4 nights in Nov 08 during election week. The first night we got stuck in a smoking room due to a huge youth convention and us arriving past 10pm to finally check in. I understand that all the other rooms may have been taken but felt disappointed that front desk didn't tell us during check-in to expect a room that was different than what we had reserved.
The next day our room was changed to a bright spacious quiet corner room, as requested in my reservation, with a view of the street just outside the hotel entrance. Nice sunny sitting area, functional granite kitchenette (bring your own pots and pans unless you're ok with rusty or scratched up ones), separate vanity area, and quality sheets were greatly appreciated. Our toddler had lots of space to play.
Internet worked fine. Just bring a cat 5.
Tried the in-house restaurant -- burger, steak, soup -- my most unfavorite meal of the trip. Service was so-so. Skip it and explore the numerous dining options all within walking distance.
Mustafa, the front desk staff person, is probably the most wonderful part of the hotel. He's friendly, helpful, and never rushed you to get to the person behind you. Thanks for making our stay a fabulous one, MUSTAFA!!!","```json

898,"Got this hotel via hotwire so I got about a 40% discount from its publish rates. Not too bad but I might get a better deal with priceline. Having said that here are the pros and cons of the hotel. Pros- nice cozy hotel, close to fisherman's wharf about 10 mins. walk to Pier39. There's a safeway and walgreen just across the street from the hotel. concierge was helpful on giving instructions for which trip to take or which public transpo to take. free wifi at the lobby only. comfortable bed, decent aircon/heater service, with in-room safety box, complimentary starbucks coffee in room, rooms are cleaned everyday and serviced nicely. Cons- expensive parking, no free wifi on rooms, small clothes storage, relatively small bathroom, no in-room refs, no in-room utensils such as spoon, fork etc., our room was way at the end of the corridor near the emergency exit at one end of the building so it is such a long walk everyday we go in out of our room. A relatively old hotel that was just re-dress or renovated with some carpets, wallpaper, repaint etc. so you could see some of its age showing.... Never tried the fitness area so can't comment on that. With swimming pool but since weather was cold never bothered to check it out also. Having said that.... this hotel is quite good since most measure hotels based on sleeping comfort and location...","```json

899,"Location, location, location! Situated in the heart of Manhattan, close to Times square, all main theatres. Central Park within a short walking distance. Priced moderately for a downtown New York hotel. Amentities are modest, service is good. The interior is showing its age, needs renovation. Wi-fi Internet was very slow, and did not work at all on the first day of our stay. If you stay on upper floors, you would have to choose between their two old, tiny, and squeaky elevators which are often hard to catch and a very narrow and steep staircase. Families with children and older travelers, beware!!! Beds were not comfortable although we are not spoilt and fussy travelers. Would recommend this hotel only if there is no better alternative in the area. We had no other choice because all other hotels in this part of Manhattan had been booked by then.","```json

900,"I recently stayed in this Hotel a trip for my daughters 21st with my sister and her daughter. This hotel is location, location, location however, it is a hotel which needs some renovations. We had a couple of issues with the Hotel firstly they take €100 off your credit card even though you have paid in full??? Breakages I was told but had we of broken anything it would have been because it was about to break. Safe instructions incorrect had to get someone to help, light switch broken, cable coming out (leaving a hole in wall). We had to bring these to attention of the hotel as we didn't want to be charged for them. Towels/bathmaths weren't replaced (4 girls in a room) toiletries very scarse still using small soaps thrown out and being replaced the next day. Because of weight restrictions on planes I dont bring these type of items. Then the toilet got blocked last straw. I rang down and was told it would be a while but the Manageress Ruth was very apologetic and would have changed us had our daughters not been out at the time she also compensated us with breakfast for the rest of our stay. When I went to reception to get the vouchers the girl on reception (cann't remember her name) wasn't as nice same girl who checked us in (€100 issue).
Service in the restaurant was very good.
Basic hotel in need of upgrading great location.","```json

**Explanation:**

1. **Group 1 (Garden Suite):** All agents agree on it being a neutral aspect of ""rooms general"" without an opinion term.
   
2. **Group 2 (Maids):** There was a mix of ""neutral"" and ""negative"" interpretations. Upon integration, it's seen as a service performed with some negative aspects, agreeing on ""service general"" and using the most fitting opinion terms from Agents 2 and 3.
   
3. **Group 3 (Floor):** There’s consistency on its negative sentiment of cleanliness, so the negative sentiment from Agents 1 and 2 was supported.

4. **Group 4 (Private Garden):** All readings align on positive sentiment for the private garden, choosing ""facilities miscellaneous"" to preserve the unique attribute of having a private space.

5. **Group 5 (Suites):** Commonly recognized as positive relating to room privacy, categorized under ""rooms general.""

6. **Group 6 (Reception):** General consensus of it being negative due to its absence, categorized under ""facilities general"" as it relates to an expectation in facility operations.

7. **Group 7 (A/C):** Uniformly recognized as negative with slightly different categories, but ""rooms comfort"" was selected for precision concerning noise affecting sleep comfort."
902,"It's not the most luxurious place I've been to and in most cities it'd be much cheaper, but this is a good base to explore most of the main sites of New York. Staff were helpful whenever we asked them anything. The room was clean, although there were a few holes in the walls and several sorts of wallpaper from different eras in the one room. No bedbugs! Wonderful old creaky lift, if you like old creaky lifts (which we did). One warning: the rooms at the front of the hotel can be even noisier than normal in New York due to the Mid Town Tunnel nearby. But then no one comes here for the quiet.....my 6 year old daughter loved the place; there's a great pizza restaurant a couple of doors down on the same street and a good diner round the corner.","```json

903,"The Hotel: As with most of SF there is limited space and although Ritz Carlton does a good job with the lobby and other areas, it just feels it needs a renovation. I may be biased beacuse I usually dont stay in SF and not used to the small size hotels. The service is typical Ritz and I say that in a good way. My one complaint would be the doormen didnt make me feel invited and seem to spend most of their time with someone who may give them a large tip. 
The Room: Small.....They do the best they can with the space they have but as mentioned before a renovation is in order and I fully understand the cost and logistics to keep the hotel open during renovation is a nightmare. We just returned from Rosewood Hotel Georgia in Vancouver and they also have limited space but Ritz should use them as an example. 
Fitness: No pool and there is a large area for yoga and stretching but again the same theme of being small with limited equipement. 
Spa: Didnt use it but the area always smells nice and the staff working the area was very nice. Tea and coffee is available near the spa.
Restaurant: We ate there twice for breakfast and it was very good. Our waiter on the first day was very nice and catered to our daughter and our friends kids very well. My wife had the buffett and she liked it but maybe a bit overpriced but the quality was definetely good. The kids french toast covered with cereal was a hit with the kids. 
The second day breakfst was a Tuesday and our waited looked like he was in training. Not as a fun an experience as the first( i wish I could remember his name to give him credit). 
Location: Good and correct from other reviews of being close to Chinatown and Union Square. Just a 5 min walk to either place. The trolley also around the corner from the hotel. Didnt have a car so cant comment on parking but Im sure it is very difficult.","```json

904,"Can't fault the location of this hotel, thought it was excellent.
Not so sure about the room.
We were on the second floor and in retrospect should have asked for a different one.
The street noise was a little bit troublesome but the main problem was the lethal step up to the toilet/ shower.
This was positively dangerous and the toilet/shower was miniscule. We are of average size and barely had room to fit in. Anyone who is slightly overweight would find it a tight squeeze.
Also the shower didn't have a curtain, so lots of possibilities of slipping over.
We also had the same problem as a previous reviewer in that our room wasn't serviced.
I suggest your cards are reworded. We were quite happy not to have our towels replaced but would have liked the beds remade and the tea/ coffee replaced.
The beds were very comfortable.
The staff were very friendly and the hotel was clean. it was just that step...................
Probably wouldn't stay here again but maybe in a better room.","```json

905,"Went down for an overnight shopping trip. 
Pro's: 
1) Very professional and friendly check in employees
2) Decent hot/cold breakfast as expected. 
3) You get a guest pass to 24Hour Fitness located across the street. Nice bonus if you are a work out freak. I unfortunately didn't bring my Nikes :(
Con's:
1) Really soft bed that squeeked...barely slept. 
2) The carpet felt dingy. Highly recommended that you wear your shoes while in suite.
3) Bathroom faucet and bar faucet have incredibly low water pressure.
4) Sketchy area. We were lucky to find street parking across the street in front of 24Hour Fitness. Felt better that the gym is open 24hours. I would have paid for valet parking otherwise = $28. 
5) Beware that this is not a quiet hotel. It's on a major street leading up to I-5. Lots of traffice in front of the hotel. 
6) Crappy TV signal. The Residence Inn Lake Union offered HD channels (for comparison). 
7) The bath curtain was cut short, I assume because the bottom was moldy and unsightly. It was so short that water from the shower created a mini-lake around the toilet. Not nice....","```json

906,"I'm very late in submitting this review. I stayed here during the weekend of the NYC Marathon in 2004 and hope to again in 2005. 
 The Good: Was perfectly located for all the things that I needed/wanted to do to get ready for the race. And other places i.e. a great pizza joint, small supermarket, 24 hour coffee shop, CVS, etc. were right around the corner. The staff members were attentive and very friendly. They had internet access available in a common area, and the gym wasn't all that awful looking either (didn't use it, though). The room was clean and the bed was so comfortable...heaven! And on Marathon Morning, the staff had complimentary water and power bars downstairs at the check in/out area. Nice touch! But really, LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION!!! That was key! I was really hurting the day after the race, and the staff was so nice in assisting me with my bags down the escalator.
 The Bad: Teeny-tiny television set, but then again, the room was very small, so a normal sized tv probably couldn't have fit in there. No small fridge, bath tub or coffee maker (all essentials for my pre- and post-race rituals). No dressers for clothes, small closet. For the most part, my clothes stayed in my suit cases. But hey, I got the room thru priceline, and at an awesome rate, so for NYC, you could do a LOT worse.
 The Ugly: Nothing....I loved the contemporary styling of the rooms and the hotel. My bathroom was spacious enough (although no tub...oh, how I needed a hot bath after the race, but that's ok). The club was opened until 3am or 4am, looked like a lot of fun (couldn't go...had to rest), and the noise stayed downstairs, which was great as it was critical that I got a good nite's sleep before the race.
 I've read other reviews pertaining to the dissatisfaction of some because of the room size, and yes, they are very tiny. But for me, the Hudson served it's purpose. It gave me a clean, quiet, COMFORTABLE place to sleep. I'd stay again in a heartbeat!","```json

907,"The hotel is a bit hard to get to – the front faces away from Colorado avenue, in fact you must turn right onto cherry creek drive then turn right into the hotel (if you’re heading north on Colorado)
I like a clean, quiet, comfortable room, with some amenities nearby (restaurants, etc). this hotel fit everything except for a few items:
Number one – the bed was way too hard. It has a control to make it softer, but didn’t seem to work. Unfortunately because the bed was so hard, I doubt I'll stay here again, which is unfortunate because the hotel does have several things that I did like.
There’s construction going on and it’s a “must” to have your car valet parked as there’s no parking. This caused us some concern as we just had our jeep restored. We were assured that it would be parked in covered and secure parking, however when we were walking to Mike’s camera, we could see our jeep sitting on the street (didn’t sit well with us)
There’s a restaurant on-site, it’s not bad, has a limited menu, though. No lunch and room service is only from 5pm – 10 pm. The morning breakfast buffet is outrageously priced ($12.95 per person). Didn’t stop by to see if they had anything other than the buffet. 
There are a few places within walking distance, Panera Bread, a Cafe Rio Mexican Grill and a Garbanzo Mediterranean Grill. We didn’t bother with anything other than the Panera Bread, because the menu at the other places just didn’t seem right.
To get to the Panera Bread, however, you have to walk in the path of cars coming into the hotel. 
We did find a good Chinese restaurant that delivered. Golden Shanghai, www.goldenshanghai-denver.com","```json

908,"Our family stayed here for a night prior to the Flower Show. The hotel is very close to the Franklin Institute, Academy Of Natural Sciences and the Convention Center.
We requested early check-in and we received our room early as requested. The rooms are large with a fridge and microwave. The bathroom was avg to small. 
The room was cold upon check-in,so we turned up the heat to 80 degrees. After a few hours, the room temperature was only 67 degrees. I called the froont desk and they sent a person right up. 
He worked on the unit for about 20 minutes and we had heat, although the fan and unit was louder than in most hotels I had stayed. We already had our stuff unpacked, so we just lived with it.
The staff is very friendly and helpful. The manager's reception offers just about anything you could want as far as drinks. The bar tender was very fast and friendly...The only drawback was the food consisted of pretzels/chips/nuts....not even close to other Embassy suites we have stayed at in New York and Florida which had a selection of hot appetizers/frozen drinks.
We heard some construction noise from the on-going renovations, but nothing too bad.
Our cooked to order breakfast was in the TGI Fridays on the second floor. The usual hot foods and omelette station which we enjoyed. Again, not comparable to other ES I stayed but a nice meal. Our rate included tickets to the flower show.
Overall, my kids had a good time (11,11,13) as did my wife and I.
I would stay here again if we come back next year. A very good value for a clean, well located hotel. Nothing too fancy but a solid value for your money..","Final ABSA Result:

### Justification for Consolidation:
- **Hotel General**: Consensus across two agents about ""Excellent hotel."" with a strong positive intensity score (4).
- **Hotel Cleanliness**: Combined results yielded a sentiment score of 3, reflecting positive comments across all agents.
- **Facilities**: Consistent results for ""Internet access"" as a positive sentiment with intensity score 2, though categories differed slighty, ""facilities miscellaneous"" was selected due to its specificity from two agents.
- **Rooms Comfort**: Agreement on the positive sentiment toward the ""bed,"" with a strong score (5).
- **Service General**: Consensus on the slight negativity of ""concierge's attitude"" and ""bell boys,"" with adjustments in intensity (-1) to reflect overall mild dissatisfaction indicated by agents."
