So, knowing that I would like wireless headphones, I shopped for ""over the ear"" headphones. I chose the Sennheiser RS 170's because of the base boost and the advertised long battery life. Not as much of a like to me was the surround sound except when it came to music. Pretty darn good!

13,"The Samsung tablet I bought this case for is already a rare item in my country, so, I had to order the case from America. It is a replacement for another case I bought here in Colombia for pretty much the same price. However, The fintie case is way better. Waaaay better. It's sturdier despite its being smaller, my tablet turns on and off pretty quickly just by opening and closing the case, taking the s-pen in and out of the tablet is very comfortable, and working with an accesory keyboard is very comfortable when I fold the cover.

UPDATE: A month, and exactly as described by other customers, my case is already cracked on the corners despite a very light use. It is a good design in other aspects such as artwork, but it's totally ruined by a very poor choice of materials.","[

The Minolta HTsi plus is easy to use for the basic features, but  if you want to use the advance feature.... reading the manuel is  recommended, but don't worry. (  )

Therefore, I asked for a return and specified the reason, immediately, I got a very polite response on the second day asking if I connect to a HDMI 1.4 cable.  (It's my bad that I didn't notice the product did specify that it needs a HDMI 1.4 cable).  So I then ordered HDMI 1.4 cable from Amazon.  After I connected to the new HDMI 1.4 cable, I have no problem to watch mirror image
from Nexus 7 onto the HDTV, which I am very happy.  However, I also tried the power charging adapter but it didn't really charge. So I wrote another email to them, I got the reply on the second day apologizing to me about the product and shipped me the replacement immediately.  The new one works quite well with the power charging. Their service is a 5 star service!!! Very courteous and effective!!","[

23,"I've reallly enjoyed this case. The keyboard is better than others I've tried. It has all of the keys separately--no using the ""a"" key as the ""shift"" as well. Easy to connect and charge. The part that holds the ipad is a little akward at first, but I've gotten use to it and really like it. I also like that I can fold the ipad over the keyboard to use as a tablet and not worry about touching the keys. Great product.","[

I have to say it does the job. My fitbit charged really fast and I was happy that I was able to use it once again. I recommend this charge. I received this product at a discounted price for exchange of my honest and unbiased review . Also that quality is pretty good.,"[

26,"I bought a SD1100 a year ago and very happy with it. This A1100 is a big disappointment. Picture quality is poor even at 12MP. When transfer to the computer for a larger view, all the grain shows up even with the flash. Second, it's TOOOO SLOOOOW, 3-5 seconds between each shot regardless of which resolution chosen: 1M, 2M 3M, etc. These shots were taken with the included 128MB SD card so one can rule out the card incompatibility. Battery life is terrible. After taking only around 20 pictures using the alkaline Panasonic batteries that came with the camera, the low battery indicator started flashing.","[

41,"THis product is simply amazing!!!! It is NOT meant to be used to carry your laptop around.  It is simply ""a shield"" to protect your laptop from scratches when you are carrying the laptop in a backpack or laptop bag.  The item is  superiorly designed.  There is a soft cushion inside the neoprene case.  ALso, since it is neoprene, it conforms to your laptop size if it is little bigger than the case.  My Dell 700m fits perfectly in this case.","[

46,"I've only had this a few days, but my initial impressions are very positive.

Basically it does everything you would expect it to do.  Power it on, connect to your computer, load it with content, download the app, set your device's wi-fi connection to connect to the wi-drive, start the app...and that's it.

Within the first hour - the USB connection for pushing content to it is sloooooow - I had an iphone, ipod touch and my Kindle Fire streaming 3 different movies perfectly well.

What I especially liked on the Kindle is you get a list of the movies!!  No more guessing with that stupid, idiotic Gallery view in the Kindle App that only shows you thumbnails and forces you to guess the movie!

It's not a full, true, wi-fi connection - so I couldn't get it to stream well from 50 feet away - but since you'll likely be sitting right next to it, you should be fine.

Battery life is actually going to be the limitation at around 4 hours (I believe), but checkout other reviews as people have discovered a workaround to get it to charge whilst streaming (which it doesn't want to do natively).","[

49,"I've been in the market for headphones ever since Walmart and Target have been making a big deal about selling earbugs that have to be jammed into your ear. Not a huge fan. Anyways, my partner referred me to these after she saw me hovering over some Beats by Dre, saying these were hands down a better deal and quality. Welp. I don't exactly know if she's wrong, buuut these definitely didn't leave my wallet crying. I love the sound quality of these, and so far as everyone says, the only down side has been the extremely long cord that is a nightmare during GYM use. But, given the price, and quality, I don't really see these losing a star over that. My partner seems to like it as I've already walked in on her dancing around the room with these bad boys - guess that long cable is useful to some people afterall.","[

I'm sure this camera works great but not including an ac charger!!!!! That's ridiculous!  Charging via usb is fine but what if you don't want to lug your laptop on vacation??? I promptly returned this product!!! I'll be more wary of buying anyting Sony in the future. Note, I own 2 PS3's and should have expected this bc Sony requires you to buy remotes along with everything else to run the Ps3's.","[

67,"ok sso I bought this amp for the power and the price. And its good in both of thoughs fields but from the moment i pluged it in it played a very loud feed back over my four speekers and not just a little bit, it was LOUD, i couldn't even turn it on a night because the people in the next room could hear the T.V. over the sound of the feed back. I called pyle and asked them to replace or fix my amp, they did... once i payed for shipping both ways 60$!!!!! and then when i finally got it back....2 weeks latter there was no change still the same feed back!!!!!!! Pyle is a good bargan company and i like their speeker components but don't buy an amp from  them, you'll regret it, and if its broken you might not want to bother returning it or getting a refund, their customer service SUCKS!!! stay away folks... if your looking for some power while still staying inside a budget try technical pro.","[

68,"I like this laptop, really i do, i just have some minor complaints due Microsoft Crappy Vista and the bloatware that Acer includes in this model, but the machine overall is good and well for less than us$ 500. A lot of hard drive ( i suppose they're offering so much of it because all of the programs that comes with it), a lot of memory etc.

Well this is a good laptop, would be better if:

a) The Operating system was other that Windows Vista ( that's a crap of an OS) Vista has failed i don't know HOW many times since i bought this laptop.
b) If this model didn't bring a ton of bloatware, and when i say a ton i MEAN IT!, a lot of games and crappy programs that you won't EVER use in your life.
c) This SHOULD come with the installing cds but NOOOO Acer had the good idea to leave that to you ( I've tried to make my backup twice and burning the second cd the operation failed) --> that's worrisome.
d) I don't like the surface of the laptop, it gets a lot of fingerprints.
e) The heat can get a little uncomfortable if you have it by say ummm 2 hours on your lap.","[

Cons:  Lacking bass but its ok.  I didn't buy this for the sound quality.  I just needed a speaker for everyday use.

Highly recommend this to all my friends!!!","[

76,Great sound as you would expect with any SONY! Radio pulls in a lot of FM stations! I don't listen to AM much but it does get all the normal AM stations for our area. Like the battery back up for the clock a lot and also automatically adjusts for DAYLIGHT SAVING time! CD player even plays all my computer made cd's! Timmer works GREAT but could be a little LOUDER! Very nice looking and easy to mount with the template and is VERY adjustable for the amount of drop distance under the cabinet in case you have a moulding on your cabinet and you need to lower the unit to clear the bottom edge! REMOTE works GREAT for complete control of all functions too!!! Buy it! You won't be sorry!!!,"[

79,This product it really awesome! First off the Bluetooth connection syncs perfectly with my Ipad Mini no delay or anything and I love how it turns my ipad on or off when I open and close it whether or not the keyboard is on or not. The only thing I had to get use to was the size of the keyboard because of its small size but that should be expected considering it is the ipad mini and also this is the product that apple recommends for the ipad mini on their website and it is a hit! I love it! I actually bought this case along with Aduro Facio Case with Bluetooth Removable Keyboard for Apple Ipad Mini and I have been unable to use it yet because I love this one so much!!!!,"[

I ordered this one because the picture showed a different tip on the stylus than the one I am used to. The tip is actually the same as other styluses, BUT, this one is WAY more responsive, and for the size, it' very accurate and it requires very little pressure.

Built a new computer for the kids to home work and surf the web with for under 170 with this case and could not be happier.  its sturdy when to gether but the thin walls allowed me to mod the case with tin snips for routing the cables away from the center  where i want nothing but airflow for my overclocked g3258. its simplistic perfection in my book, and on the cheap!","[

89,"I did alot of research before buying this and after several weeks bought the 605 30gb. I am happy with my purchase, but I would like to say that there are a few things you will need to realize before you buy this #1 I was confused about if this thing had a SD slot and it doesn't which was my own fault I didn't read the description better (the smaller one I think its like a 10gb not sure is the only one that has the SD slot #2 I bought mine to take on tripos and watch movies on and it works great (excellent picture and quailty) and after buying all the extra plug-ins was able to surf the web (now let me say this aint no laptop so if your buying exspecting the same speed as a laptop better save your money and buy one but if you are just looking to check your mail do alittle surffing and be able to slide it into your pocket after you got the best) #3 I would like to say that the customer sewrvice really SUCKS, and for the money you have to spend on this it seems like they would treat the customer better. #4My only real complaint with my 605 is thatthe battery is awful and since it isn't replacable that makes it a major problem (mine only last maybe 4-6 hours) I have to say I thought I might have made a mistake buying a 30gb but I have alot of music on mine and keep maybe 4-5 movies on at alll times but could easly have 30 if I wanted I just erase them after I get through and load on a new onefrom my desktop which is really easy (and I aint the most computer friendly person in the world). Oh one more thing the speakers?!?!?! Weeelllll lets just say it aint no bose sound system it is what it is a personal player and with the includede earbuds it works great but if you are going to trey and use it as a sterio you won't be happy unless you get that thing archs has you can set the unit into and plug up to that has built in speakers, my next purchase is gonna be a DVR staion I am waiting a few months for the new to ware off so I can get a refurbished or atleast alittle better price. Good luck with your decission and I hope I helped you alittle ans sorry about the misspelled words.","[

97,"This TV is great, it's my 3rd samsung i've purchased and definitely the best, I bought one of the earlier LED TV samsungs and they are great but the interface on this newer model is amazing. It's sooo easy to use, the build quality is like German engineering, even the remote exudes German quality even though it's from Korea. I think Samsung have taken quality build to the next level with this product. It isn't kitchy, it's quality, love it highly recommended. I thought of buying the more expensive ones but this one is perfect, i've not a 50/60/75hz or whatever it is snob, the picture quality is AMAZING and unlike the older Samsung LED TV's the sound quality is superb. Samsung have really hit a home run with this TV.","[

98,"Started really working out about 4 months ago, and realized just how much I sweat. Never really liked the cheap white earbuds that came with my ipod to begin with, but once I started working out I noticed they don't like sweat, cutting out, falling out, being uncomfortable, etc. So I thought I'd give these a try. Well worth the money. They sound great, way better then those tin can sounding, little, hard white things. They hold up to my sweaty workout routines, they fit nice, and come with different sized plastic dealies for different sized earholes (yea I said earhole). Not to mention they sound waaaaaaay better than what I'm used to. All in all, unless your an audiofile freak who needs perfect concert sound. These little babies are pretty sweet.","[
